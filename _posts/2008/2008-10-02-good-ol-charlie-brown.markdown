<p>Today, October 2, is "Peanuts day," since it marks the anniversary of the date of the first Peanuts cartoon in 1950.  <a href="http://www.snoopy.com/">Snoopy.com</a>, the official online home of all things Peanuts, has <a href="http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/meet_the_gang/meet_charlie_brown.html">the first Peanuts comic strip</a>.  Being a conscientious blogger, I won't just swipe and reprint it here -- you really should <a href="http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/meet_the_gang/meet_charlie_brown.html">click on through</a>.</p>

<p>What I love about that first strip is how true to form it is in terms of <em>tone</em>; sure the characters and their voices evolved over the years, but even the first one is spot on.  (You can also learn at Snoopy.com that it took less than a year for Charlie Brown to first be called a blockhead.)  My kids are getting into Peanuts now, and I need to put some of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=blended&amp;keywords=peanuts%20box%20set&amp;_encoding=UTF8">Peanuts box sets</a> on my wishlist for Christmas, so they can spend extended periods of time soaking up "the strip's still-surprising balance of exuberance and misery."[1]</p>

<p>[1] That line's from the Amazon.com review of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Schulz-Peanuts-Biography-David-Michaelis/dp/0060937998/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222988116&amp;sr=8-1">Schulz and Peanuts biography</a>. And you know what? I actually like most Amazon.com reviews.    </p>
