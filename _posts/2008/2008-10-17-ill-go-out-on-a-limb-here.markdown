<p>Stating the obvious: <a href="http://www.wthemovie.com/">W</a>'s gonna bomb.  Oliver Stone jumped the shark with <em>Born on the Fourth of July</em>; people on the right will hate it without seeing it; and even the rabidly liberal probably don't want to spend their Saturday night reliving the present in a dark room, even if it is Josh Brolin.  Best line from the <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/movies/17ston.html?8dpc">Times review</a>, on Brolin's performance:  "Good as he is, he canâ€™t touch the original."</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I love this line from <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/10/18/aVeryShortReviewOfW.html">Dave Winer's review</a>:  "Well, it was a nice movie, but I never really got into the plot. It could be I know too much about the actual story, like having read the book before seeing the movie."</p>
