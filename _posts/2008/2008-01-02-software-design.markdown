<p>Kai Krause <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_16.html#krause">answers John Brockman's question What Have You Changed Your Mind About</a> with an interesting take on the nature of software design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I used to think "Software Design" is an art form.</p>

  <p>I now believe that I was half-right: it is indeed an art, but it has a rather short half-life: Software is merely a performance art!</p>

  <p>A momentary flash of brilliance, doomed to be overtaken by the next wave, or maybe even by its own sequel. Eaten alive by its successors. And time...</p>

  <p>This is not to denigrate the genre of performance art: anamorphic sidewalk chalk drawings, <a href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=andy+goldsworthy+pebble&amp;btnG=Search+Images">Goldsworthy pebble piles</a> or Norwegian carved-ice-hotels are admirable feats of human ingenuity, but they all share that ephemeral time limit: the first rain, wind or heat will dissolve the beauty, and the artist must be well aware of its fleeting glory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(That link there?  To the Goldsworthy images?  That's what they call "added value.")</p>
