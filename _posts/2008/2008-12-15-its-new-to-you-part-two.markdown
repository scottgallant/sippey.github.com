<p>I think I&#8217;ve discovered a microtrend:  reviews of things that aren&#8217;t new.  There&#8217;s reviewing things <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/12/its-new-to-you.html">everyone else has read but you haven&#8217;t</a>, or there&#8217;s reviewing things you&#8217;ve already read&#8230;and maybe some of your readers haven&#8217;t. Example: Cynthia Crossen <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122929236542205063.html">reviews</a> John le Carré&#8217;s 1986 <em>A Perfect Spy</em> in today&#8217;s Wall Street Journal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, I don&#8217;t reread because so often the books disappoint me, and I feel as if I&#8217;ve lost an old friend. With the element of surprise gone, most books seem less powerful to me on a second read. It&#8217;s as though I&#8217;ve developed scar tissue.</p>

<p>You can buy the paperback edition of A Perfect Spy for a shade under $11, or if you have a le Carré fan on your Christmas list, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2F0743457927%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Ddp%255Folp%255Fcollectible%26condition%3Dcollectible&amp;tag=statingtheobviou&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">first edition first printing</a> for just under $33.</p>
