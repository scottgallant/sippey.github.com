<p>I love(d) <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=las%20manitas&amp;w=all">Las Manitas</a> as much as the next only-occasional Austin interloper, and last time I was there I ate breakfast there each and every day.  Yum.  And sure, as an only-occasional Austin interloper, it's depressing that the building's being replaced by a new Marriott hotel complex.  But, as the <a href="http://austinist.com/2008/09/03/las_manitas_closed_forever.php">Austinist points out</a>, the story's complicated (city council, a proposal of forgivable loans, public outcry, etc.).  And, as always, the comments are where it's at...including <a href="http://austinist.com/2008/09/03/las_manitas_closed_forever.php#comment-1453014">this gem</a> from <a href="http://austinist.com/profile/Grape%20Ape">Grape Ape</a>:</p>

  <p>While having 8 or so Marriot's downtown isn't the best solution, tourism is nice. It does allow for new and existing businesses to grow. If only we could go back to just having all those 1 level dirt parking lots and empty buildings downtown - that would be awesome. Maybe then we could change our motto to "Keep Austin Mediocre and Unsuccessful"</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>
