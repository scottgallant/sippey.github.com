<p><strong>Last night, 10:30 pm:</strong>&nbsp; Finished watching our Tivo'd version of the Oscars.&nbsp; Ba-boop'd our way through the montages.&nbsp; Did email during some of the songs.&nbsp; Didn't liveblog.</p>

<p><strong>Last night, 10:40 pm:</strong>&nbsp; Check in on Vox neighborhood.&nbsp; Hey, <a href="http://anil.vox.com/library/post/its-the-oscars-tee-em.html">Anil liveblogged the Oscars</a>!&nbsp; Skim skim skim, scroll scroll, scroll.&nbsp; Here's a funny line: &quot;Poor Nicole Kidman, ruined herself. Used to be fetching. I'm just saying. I do like her brave choice to wear a chandelier.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Last night, 11:30 pm:</strong>&nbsp; Oh, hey, looks like <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/02/liveblogging-the-oscars">Jason liveblogged not watching the Oscars</a>. How clever.&nbsp; &quot;My liveblogging outfit this evening: jeans by Banana Republic, long sleeve tshirt by American Apparel, socks by Wal-Mart, boxer shorts by Muji.&quot; (Ahem, that sounds like a series of Facebook is statements to me.)</p>

<p><strong>This morning, 11:00 am:</strong>&nbsp; Wow, <a href="http://hello.typepad.com/hello/2008/02/liveblogging-th.html">David liveblogged 'em</a>, too.&nbsp; &quot;I think Owen Wilson should take over Heath Ledger's career.&quot;&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Excellent idea. Couldn't have said it better myself.</p>

<p><strong>This morning, 11:25 am: </strong>OK, that's enough.</p>
