<p>For the record, I'm enjoying Malcom Gladwell's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316017922/statingtheobviou">Outliers</a></em>.  </p>

<p>Then again, when you factor in my upper-middle class midwestern upbringing, my very liberal arts degree obtained at the height of the postmodernist canon-attacking late eighties / early nineties, my career path in high technology and the 10,000 hours of diligent work I've invested preparing for the act of reading it, this shouldn't come as a surprise. </p>
