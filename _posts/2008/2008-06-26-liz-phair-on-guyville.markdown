<p>Liz Phair's made a new documentary about her 1993 landmark "Exile in Guyville," timed with a reissue of the album. New York Mag's Vulture has a <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/06/liz_phair_on_going_back_to_guy.html">great interview with her</a>, and as the father of two daughters whom I'm doing my best to raise as strong, vocal and opinionated young girls (and me arguably being one of those "guys") I absolutely loved this particular bit...Â </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>It was interesting to learn from the documentary that you were pretty surrounded by guys on the making of Exile.</strong><br>
I really was in Guyville. When I went back to the documentary, the one unifying thing with the guys is, they all talk a really long time, and then I get a tiny little word in edgewise. They were all like, "This is what's good," "This is what you should like," and I was like, [sing-songy] "fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you."

<p>The documentary's bundled with the CD version of the reissue -- you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exile-Guyville-Liz-Phair/dp/B00197KG4S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1214344854&amp;sr=1-1">pick it up at Amazon</a> and other fine retailers, I assume.</p>
