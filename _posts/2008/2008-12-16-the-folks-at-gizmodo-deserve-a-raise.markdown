<p>Gizmodo covers the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5111464/analyst-hot-for-apple-netbook-at-macworld">speculation on an Apple netbook for Macworld</a>; but I’m fairly certain that the post was an excuse to publish the best artist’s rendition of an unreleased Apple product <em>evar</em>. It’s so good I won’t swipe it for myself — they deserve all the page views they can get for this one so click, dammit. Click.</p>
