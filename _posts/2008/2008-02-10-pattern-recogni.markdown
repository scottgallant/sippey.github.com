<p>So I'm making my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400063515/statingtheobviou">The Black Swan</a>; highly recommended. IAONAN (I Am Obviously Not A Neuroscientist), but Taleb's argument that our brains just aren't wired for outliers seems to be the flip side (in a good way) of Jeff Hawkins' descriptions of conscious thought in <a href="http://www.onintelligence.org/">On Intelligence</a>. Our brains are constantly doing pattern recognition, looking for how things fit...and being (quite literally) surprised when they don't. (And &quot;click&quot; went my brain.)&nbsp; Plus, I haven't come across more descriptive terms than &quot;mediocristan&quot; and &quot;extremistan.&quot; Perfect.</p>
