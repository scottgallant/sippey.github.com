<p>Today's fascination: <a href="http://www.blogs.com/search/big+tent">The Big Tent</a>, the home of bloggers at the convention in Denver. Kelly Nuxoll at Huffington Post has a great post today describing <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kelly-nuxoll/big-tent-tour-inside-blog_b_121044.html">the ins and outs of the tent</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With sponsorship from Google and Digg, among others, the Big Tent expanded to offer a lounge, a stage where speakers could address audiences of up to 350, breakout rooms for smaller gatherings, free lunch and dinner, a beer garden with an open tap, morning yoga, and a spa. A convention and media center in one, the Big Tent went up in two weeks and offers more wireless portals than the Denver Airport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm especially interested in the interplay between the media producers in the Big Tent and, well, "traditional" media folks. Nuxoll again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best-case scenario may be that the Big Tent brings more people into politics by giving them more access to media and to each other. The worst-case scenario may be that the Big Tent, which includes a VIP blogger lounge, is a victim of its own success, substituting one exclusive political culture for another.</p>
