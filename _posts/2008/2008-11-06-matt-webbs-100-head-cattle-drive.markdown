<p>Matt Webb likes plastic cows.  <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/more/2008/11/cattledrive/">And he wants 100 of them</a>.  But, as he says, "there is no way I can justify to myself spending that much money on plastic cows. Really, there is no way."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I could however justify giving that same amount of money, or more, to a worthwhile charity. That would be an easy thing. And while I personally could not justify splashing coins on plastic cattle, I would be perfectly happy encouraging 100 other people to each spend 1% of that (plus postage and packing). This is because of my willingness to take advantage of that happy human psychological miracle called out of sight, out of mind.</p>

  <p>A promise: IF I GET 100 × SCHLEICH HOLSTEIN OR FLECKVIEH COWS, I WILL DONATE £500 TO A CHARITY CHOSEN BY MAJORITY VOTE.</p>
