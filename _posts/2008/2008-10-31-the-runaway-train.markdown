<p>Peggy Noonan&#39;s opinion piece in today&#39;s Wall Street Journal, &quot;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122539802263585317.html">Obama and the Runaway Train</a>,&quot; is worth reading.&#0160; &quot;Let&#39;s be frank. Something new is happening in America. It is the
imminent arrival of a new liberal moment. History happens, it makes its
turns, you hold on for dear life. Life <em>moves</em>.&quot;</p>
