<p>Congrats to the delicious team on the launch of the new <a href="http://www.delicious.com/">delicious.com</a>. As an <a href="http://delicious.com/msippey">active user</a>, I&#39;ve been looking forward to the refresh for a little while now, and I&#39;m happy to have it live! Here are a few of the things I like...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Date grouping! It&#39;s a simple thing, but it really makes it visually clear how much linking activity I&#39;ve been doing lately.</p></li>
<li><p>Top ten tags! I&#39;m pretty sure I could have done that before with the controls that were there, but the new look of that right-hand module is clean, simple and straightforward. </p></li>
<li><p>Tag intersection UI! While the visual look implies more of a category &gt; subcategory model instead of a pure tag intersection model, the way they&#39;ve implemented it will make me much more likely to go to my archives to find things like &quot;<a href="http://delicious.com/msippey/software+small">small+software</a>.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Long notes! Yeah, I like them <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/07/31/delicious-relaunch">too</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The launch video! Definitely <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deliciousblog/2718285703/">worth watching</a>, especially if you&#39;re one of those people (like me) who likes words moving around on a screen.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And since it wouldn&#39;t be fair and balanced without one thing I&#39;m not a fan of, I&#39;ll share this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m not a fan of the new little &quot;person&quot; that&#39;s there. I&#39;ve always loved the simple delicious identity of the blue, black and white favicon; I&#39;m not sure that the bookmark needed to be anthropomorphized.</li>
</ul>

<p>To date I&#39;ve shared 1,254 bookmarks on delicious. Here&#39;s to the next 1,254!</p>
