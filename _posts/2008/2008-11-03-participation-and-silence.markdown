<p>As part of the upcoming exhibition <a href="http://sfmoma.org/exhibitions/306">The Art of Participation</a> (which I'm looking forward to almost as much as the <a href="http://sfmoma.org/exhibitions/334">Martin Puryear</a> show, which opens the same day), SFMOMA will be staging <a href="http://sfmoma.org/events/1258">performances of John Cage's <em>4'33"</em></a> in the galleries.  Also part of the show are a few online works that will tickle the memories of oldtimers, including <a href="http://www.bumplist.net/">Bumplist</a> and <a href="http://www.communimage.net/">Communimage</a>.</p>
