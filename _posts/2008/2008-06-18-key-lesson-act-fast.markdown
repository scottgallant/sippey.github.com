<p>I continue to be super excited for Jen Bekman and what she&#39;s doing with <a href="http://www.20x200.com/">20x200</a>.&#0160;I just clicked through on today&#39;s message about the latest piece from James Rajotte titled <a href="http://www.20x200.com/art/2008/06/auditorium.html">Auditorium</a>, and the 200 run edition of the smaller piece had already sold out. &#0160;(Damn!)</p>
