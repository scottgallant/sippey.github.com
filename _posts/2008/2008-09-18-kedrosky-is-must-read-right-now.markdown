<p>If you're not following / subscribed to Paul Kedrosky's blog <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/">Infectious Greed</a>, and anxiously awaiting each and every blog post, then you absolutely should be.  He's doing the best blogging about the market meltdown, including this morning's post about <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2008/09/18/fire_the_secs_c.html">McCain calling for the head of Chris Cox</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the height of irresponsibility for a politician to grandstand so clumsily when the market is as fragile as it is right now. It shows a remarkable lack of financial sophistication and market smarts on the part of John McCain, and I didn't have much confidence in either from him in the first place (and that does not make this an Obama endorsement, because he has done diddly to convince me he gets this either).</p>
