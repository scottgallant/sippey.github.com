<p>I really want to see this installation in person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.chrisoshea.org/projects/audience/">Audience</a>, conceived by rAndom International, is an installation consisting of around 64 head-size mirror objects. Each object moves its head in a particular way to give it different characteristics of human behaviour. ... When members of the audience occupy the space, the mirrors inquisitively follow someone that they find interesting. Having chosen their subject, they all synchronise and turn their heads towards them. Suddenly that person can see their reflection in all of the mirrors.</p>

<p>Words don't do it justice.  Go watch the <a href="http://vimeo.com/1842245">video</a> on Vimeo and check out this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixelsumo/sets/72157607056355361/">photo set</a> on Flickr.</p>
