<p>From the "short messages not sent" department.</p>

<ul>
<li>Putting a new watch on your wrist changes how you perceive time.</li>
<li>I spend way too many cycles messing with sync, even though I think I have a decent system figured out to work around the awkward combination of Microsoft Exchange, Apple iCal, an iPhone, Mail.app and Entourage. </li>
<li>When I'm not online I can string more than a few hundred words together at once, and have them make sense.  This is good.</li>
<li>That said, midtown hotel lobby + powerstrips + wifi = WIN.</li>
<li>When you have to pay to use something to its full advantage, it's not <em>really</em> free.</li>
<li>Season two of The Wire gets <em>really</em> interesting around episode 8.  Looking forward to the next four.</li>
<li>I'm still waiting for a delivery date on the Kindle I ordered.  I'm tempted to cancel.</li>
</ul>

<p>OK, that second one up there wasn't so short.</p>
