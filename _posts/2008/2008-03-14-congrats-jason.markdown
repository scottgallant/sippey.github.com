<p>So <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/03/kottkeorg-is-ten-years-old-today">Kottke.org turns 10 today</a>.&nbsp; Huge kudos and congrats!&nbsp; Jason is truly a pioneering blogger, and despite the explosion of blogs in the last few years, is doing something that is rare and remarkable: delivering a constant stream of high quality content on a wide variety of subjects -- <strong>the things that matter to him</strong>.</p>

<p>And he's incredibly passionate about that singular / wide-ranging focus.&nbsp; If you missed it, the other day Jason posted a <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/03/the-end-of-the-wire">great piece on one of his more recent obsessions, The Wire</a>.&nbsp; (I've had to ignore most of what he's been writing about The Wire, since I'm only through season three.) In response, one of his readers commented...</p><blockquote><p>Believe it or not, many of your loyal readers weren't all that interested in &quot;The Wire&quot; and were getting really really really sick of hearing about it.</p></blockquote><p>To which Jason responded...</p><blockquote><p>Please, go away. Seriously. If you're not interested, stop reading. Go outside with a favorite book or something instead. I thought my approach to kottke.org was fairly clear after almost 10 years: I DON'T FUCKING CARE WHAT YOU DO OR DO NOT WANT TO READ ABOUT. I post, you read, that's the deal. There's no &quot;I'd like four graphic design posts, two book reviews, and something about photography with a side of bacon, hold the mayo&quot;. If you don't like my filter, there are literally millions of other blogs out there to choose from.</p></blockquote><p>Now, I'm probably embarrassing him a bit by calling out this comment, since Jason is one of the the nicest and most mild-mannered guys I know. But this was one of the better blog comments I've read recently (and I've been reading a lot of them), because it nutshelled exactly what I love about Kottke.org.&nbsp; Jason blogs about what interests him, in his own voice, with passion and consistency.&nbsp; And to do what he's done, at the level he's done it, for that long, is commendable.</p>

<p>Congrats, Jason!&nbsp; Here's to the next ten years.</p>
