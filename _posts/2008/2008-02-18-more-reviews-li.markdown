<p>Wil Shipley of <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> fame posts a <a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/02/macbook-air-rambling-first-impressions.html">fantastic review of the Air</a>, hitting all the right notes, including this pitch-perfect one:</p><blockquote><p>Jonathan Ive should design a laptop bag as beautiful as the Air, that
just can contain the machine, a power cord, and a Wireless Mighty
Mouse. I'd be in heaven. Nobody seems to have addressed the &quot;I want a
small, slim bag that can still hold a power cord without having a giant
wart in the side&quot; market. Like, duh, bag designers, STOW THE POWER CORD
ABOVE OR BELOW THE LAPTOP, not STICKING OUT THE SIDE WHERE IT CREATES A
TENT AND LOOKS UGLY AND BANGS MY KNEE.</p></blockquote><p>+1</p>
