<p>Via <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2008/07/tuesday_links_10.html">Modern Art Notes</a>, Time's Richard Lacayo on the <a href="http://time-blog.com/looking_around/2008/07/a_few_things_from_england.html">connection between Monet's <em>Water Lilies</em> and Mark Rothko</a> made real at Tate Modern. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Going back and forth between the two canvases, you could understand in an almost physical way how Rothko's picture operates, how its vertical orientation and near human-scale dimensions, its direct address to your eye, brain and body, condenses the visual field of Monet's horizontal image and untethers it from its last connections to the visible world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, art speak. I know. But if you're at all a Rothko fan, you'll <em>get it</em>. (Lacayo's piece has the images to prove his point, so, y'know, click through.)</p>
