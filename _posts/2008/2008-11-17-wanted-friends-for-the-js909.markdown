<p>I love <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/JS-909/">JS-909</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-909">Roland TR-909</a> drum machine emulator built entirely in JavaScript. After I finish a pattern, though, all I want to do is save it, share it, link to it, find and friend other people making patterns, listen to theirs, borrow and steal from them, learn from them and make more.</p>

<p>Instead, I'm stuck with my simple dance track that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3039766815/">looks like this</a>. Feel free to replicate that pattern manually and rock out with me in spirit.</p>
