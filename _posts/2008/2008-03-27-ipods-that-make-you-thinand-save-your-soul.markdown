<p>I love this little tidbit from the <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/03/27/apple_developing_full_fledge_digital_lifestyle_fitness_companion.html">Apple patent filing</a> today...</p><blockquote>
The lifestyle companion system also can interview the user about non-health related topics, e.g., spirituality/religion, identity (e.g., sense of belonging), relationships, career, financial condition, environment, hobbies, interests, other personal information, and goals regarding the same.&#0160;

<p>Can&#39;t wait to see the privacy policy on that one.</p>
