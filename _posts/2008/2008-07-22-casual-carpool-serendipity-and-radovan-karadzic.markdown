<p>"<a href="http://www.ridenow.org/carpool/">Casual carpool</a>" is one of those (sub)urban fabric things that makes life in the Bay Area go 'round...and occasionally makes it just a bit more interesting. Every morning commuters gather at one of a couple dozen sites in the East Bay, matching up drivers with passengers to make the trip across the Bay Bridge. Passengers get a free ride into the city, and drivers get passage into the H.O.V. lane, and a free ride through the toll plaza. I've been doing casual carpool (as a passenger and a driver) on and off for about the past 10 years, and every once in a while something extraordinary happens.</p>

<p>This morning on my way in I picked up two passengers, and with the radio tuned to our local NPR affiliate (I'm fairly certain that there's a law on the books in Berkeley that states that casual carpool vehicles must have their radios tuned to NPR), we made our way to the bridge.</p>

<p>The lead story in the 8:00 hour was, of course, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92768042">the arrest of Radovan Karadzic</a>, the man behind the three-year siege of Sarajevo and the massacre at Srebrenica. As the story began, a gasp came from woman in the back seat of the car, and while the story played on she interjected with the occasional sotto voce "Oh my God" and "Finally."</p>

<p>When the story ended, she offered up an explanation. "I worked for the United Nations for two years collecting evidence for the case against against Karadzic," she said. "I've waited a long time for this."</p>

<p>Every once in a while casual carpool produces nice little moments of serendipity...and I'm sure the occasional <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/mis/">missed connection</a>. This morning took the cake for me: this stranger had devoted two years of her life to the case, and I got to witness her hearing the news of his arrest for the first time. As the kids would say, <strong>[this is good]</strong>.</p>

<p>As she got out of the car at 2nd and Howard, I offered my usual "Have a great day." </p>

<p>"I already am," she replied.</p>
