<p>If you're a classical music fan, about this time every year you're probably jonesing for a trip to the <a href="http://www.aspenmusicfestival.com/">Aspen Music Festival</a>. I was lucky enough to be there for a weekend several years back, and the combination of the setting, the students and the stars turn it into something really special. (My sister is lucky enough to be there all year round, since she works for the festival as an admissions officer.)</p>

<p>Though it's not the same as being there, this year they're streaming a slew of concerts from this week's slate on <a href="http://www.medici.tv/">medici.tv</a>, which is a beautiful site from Medici Arts that offers a program of high quality video of concerts from around the world. Definitely worth checking out.</p>
