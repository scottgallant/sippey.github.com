<p><strong>â€œI want to thank you, Mr. Secretary, for working over the weekend.&quot;</strong><br />President Bush, thanking Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for, ya know, putting in a few extra hours to prop up the financial markets.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, there was a piece in the Times on Sunday morning before the JP Morgan deal was announced that valued the Bear Stearns tower in midtown at $1 billion.&nbsp; Compare and contrast that figure with the $270 million purchase price for the firm...including the real estate.</p>
