<p>I really need to start blogging something other than the Times, but alas, here's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02wwln-medium-t.html">Virginia Heffernan on her Kindle</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t seem to put it down. It’s ideal for book reading — lucid, light — but lately it has become something more: a kind of refuge. Unlike the other devices that clatter in my shoulder bag, the Kindle isn’t a big greedy magnet for the world’s signals. It doesn’t pulse with clocks, blaze with video or squall with incoming bulletins and demands. It’s almost dead, actually. Lifeless. Just a lump in my hands or my bag, exiled from the crisscrossing of infinite cybernetworks. It’s almost like a book.</p>
