<p><strong>“We’re on track for a terrific show this year,”</strong> said Paul Kent, IDG’s general manager for Macworld, <a href="http://apple20.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/12/16/steve-jobs-wont-give-macworld-keynote/">when asked to comment</a> on the news that Steve Jobs won’t be keynoting January’s event and that Apple will be pulling out of the event after 2009.</p>

<p>Perhaps he meant the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/terrific">archaic definition of terrific</a>?</p>
