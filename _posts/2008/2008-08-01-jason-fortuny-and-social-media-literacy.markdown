<p>Somewhere in me I have a thousand word post on the need for social media literacy education in lower education[1]...but for today I'll just quote Jason Fortuny in the everywhere-linked <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">New York Times piece on Internet trolls</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"You seem to know exactly how much you can get away with, and you troll right up to that line," I said. "Is there anything that can be done on the Internet that shouldn’t be done?"</p>

  <p>Fortuny was silent. In four days of conversation, this was the first time he did not have an answer ready.</p>

  <p>"I don’t know," he said. "I have to think about it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's the old standby?  There's a fine line between clever and stupid?</p>

<p>[1] In short, "media literacy" was focused on creating smarter media <em>consumers</em>; understanding how media's produced and distributed, the biases behind it, etc. (See also deconstructionism, etc.)  "Social media literacy," on the other hand, needs to be focused on creating smarter media <em>producers</em>, who understand the ramifications of a hyper-connected zero-cost-of-distribution world.  (See also Star Wars kid.)</p>
