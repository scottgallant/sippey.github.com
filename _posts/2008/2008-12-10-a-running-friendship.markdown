<p>I&#39;m not a runner, and I don&#39;t have any friendships based on running, but I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t point you to Sara Corbett&#39;s new piece in <span style="font-style: italic;">Runner&#39;s World</span>,&#0160;<a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-369-374--12992-1-1X2X3X4X5-6,00.html">Someone to Run With</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Any friendship that is based on running is, in essence, about accrual -- of time, of miles, of intimacy built over a lot of small steps forward. It sneaks up on you that way, I think. It can seem merely enjoyable until you need it for more.</p></blockquote>

<p>Worth reading in full, especially for the lovingly run-on description of her friend Clare. (I won&#39;t ruin it for you, go read it in context.) If Corbett&#39;s name seems familiar it&#39;s probably because you&#39;ve spent hours with her on the weekends: she&#39;s a a contributing writer to the Sunday Magazine in the New York Times. This past April had a long piece there on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html?sq=sara%20corbett&amp;st=nyt&amp;scp=3&amp;pagewanted=all">cellphones and global poverty</a>.</p>
