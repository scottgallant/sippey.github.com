<p>An afternoon discussion about the perceived differences between Ike Turner and James Taylor turned up this gem of a paragraph about Taylor on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Taylor">his Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the early 1980s Taylor's career was again beset by drug problems. Additionally, Taylor's wife, Carly Simon, was unhappy with his extended absences due to touring, as well as the ongoing drug abuse. After an ultimatum that he spend more time with their children, Taylor responded instead with the 1981 album <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dad-Loves-Work-James-Taylor/dp/B00004SVK9">Dad Loves His Work</a></em>. He and Simon divorced in 1983.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That last sentence is just pitch perfect.</p>
