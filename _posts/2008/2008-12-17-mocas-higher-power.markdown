<p>Tyler Green continues to do <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2008/12/making_sense_of_a_total_mess_o.html">the best blogging</a> on the MOCA mess.</p>

<blockquote>
Just in case it needs be said again, the MOCA trustees are proving that they&#8217;re the worst art museum board in America. &#8230; The idiocy of this cannot be overstated: The MOCA board is apparently more willing to inflict upon itself an embarrassing public failure than it is to admit it needs help. Is there a 12-step program for non-profit mismanagement?
</blockquote>

<p>Question:  if MOCA was to go through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program">12 step program</a>, who would be their higher power?  Eli Broad?  Michael Govan from LACMA?  James Wood from the Getty?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Looks like it wouldn't be Wood, since the <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2008/12/getty_endowment_down_25_percen.html">Getty endowment is down 25 percent</a> since June...</p>
