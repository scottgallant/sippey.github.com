<p>Bill Clinton on Saturday in North Carolina:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Jesse Jackson won in South Carolina twice, in '84 and '88, and he ran a good campaign. And Senator Obama is running a good campaign.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Jesse Jackson, reached by phone in India by the <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/jackson-not-upset-by-clinton-remarks/index.html?hp">New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I don't read anything negative into Mr. Clinton's observation.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Riiiiiight.</p>
