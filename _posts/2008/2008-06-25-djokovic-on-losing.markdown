<p>Sure, Tiger has his knee problems, but here&#39;s some cross-sport support for the kernel of truth in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAn71OPYSvc">Nike ad</a> about mental toughness, Wimbledon third seed Navat Djokovic <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/sports/tennis/26wimble.html?_r=1&amp;ref=tennis&amp;oref=slogin">on losing</a> to unseeded Marat Safin.</p><p><blockquote><p>In the end, this is another reason to show to the people that this is a very mental game. ... Even though you are feeling great in certain moments and feeling a lot of confidence and motivation, everything can blow away in a second if you are mentally not ready and prepared for the challenge. Today, I had just a block, a mental block.</p></blockquote></p>
