<p>I&#8217;ve never done one of these posts and I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m starting now, but here&#8217;s a recap of the year on this is sippey.typepad.com.</p>

<p>First, these were the top five posts based on traffic.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/12/project-management-lingo.html">Project Management Lingo</a>, where I swiped content from a mailing list, put it in list form and got a link from Kottke.</li>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/09/insane-skateboarders.html">Holy mother of god they&#8217;re nuts</a>, where I swiped a video from Vimeo, took five minutes to add a map to it and got links from Waxy <em>and</em> Kottke.</li>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/03/were-here-to-co.html">We&#8217;re here to compete</a>, where I defended Six Apart against charges of playing dirty in the marketplace, and got a link from Matt.</li>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/10/restaurants-should-do-the-math-for-you.html">Restaurants should do the math for you</a>, where I took five minutes to write up a simple idea I&#8217;ve had for years, and got a link from Waxy.</li>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/12/kanye-west-album-generator.html">Kanye West Album Generator</a>, where I took five minutes to sketch up an idea I stole from Anil (it&#8217;s true! I&#8217;m a thief!), and I don&#8217;t think he even linked to me.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note to self: if optimizing for traffic, then write more lists and/or link bait.  On the flip side, here are five of my favorite posts that <em>weren&#8217;t</em> big traffic magnets.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/07/casual-carpool-serendipity-and-radovan-karadzic.html">Casual carpool, serendipity and radovan kardzic</a> is a telling of a trip across the Bay Bridge that made my <em>week</em>.</li>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/11/wanted-friends-for-the-js909.html">Wanted, friends for the js-909</a>, which still has me thinking about how small a unit of media can be. If <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com">Kuler</a> can turn the simple <em>color swatch</em> into the point of reference for a community, why not drum patterns?</li>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/03/hal-riney-and-t.html">Notes on the death of Hal Riney</a> mourned the loss of the golden-throated ad man, and posited that there&#8217;s no way in hell those Saturn ads would work today.</li>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/06/upgrading-your-television-is-too-hard.html">Upgrading your television is too hard</a>, in which I posed a simple question &#8212; how the hell do I switch to HD? &#8212; and had a <em>ton</em> of interesting people with great ideas chimed in.  I <em>still</em> need to write the follow up post.</li>
<li><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/05/next-up-our-own-executive-chef.html">Next up, our own executive chef</a> is just a time lapse video of Mena Trott cutting David Recordon&#8217;s hair.</li>
</ol>

<p>As if the difference between the top five in traffic and my fave five weren&#8217;t stark enough, I&#8217;ll make it abundantly clear: I blog for me, and I don&#8217;t really blog about anything in particular&#8230;other than what I think is interesting enough to blog about. If I were optimizing for pageviews, there&#8217;d be more lists, more link bait and possibly more posts about the relationship between attention and authority.  Or authority and followers.  Or the attention span of idiot land.  Or something.</p>

<p>OK, then!  Here&#8217;s a fancy data visualization of my posting activity by month.  This&#8217;ll drive the page views:</p>

<p>And since the world is made up of more than ordered lists, here&#8217;s an <em>un</em>ordered list for you.  (I know, breathe deep.)</p>

<ul>
<li>I probably redesigned the site about eighteen times this year. Not only do I have a short attention span, but I also like mucking with the new design capabilities that we&#8217;re bringing to TypePad.</li>
<li>For a while I was auto-posting links from Delicious, but I realized that I hate it when other bloggers do that on their site / feed, so I stopped doing that.</li>
<li>Blogging is part of a <em>mix</em> of how an individual can participate online. My (Movable Type-powered) <a href="http://sippey.com/">action stream at sippey.com</a> is a view into all the sharing, favoriting, posting, saving and tweeting activity I&#8217;m doing.  But to play to a recent meme, it&#8217;s on my blog where I have home field advantage.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m more heterogenous in how I&#8217;m blogging lately &#8212; some posts by email, some posts from the TypePad web UI, some posts via the TextMate blogging bundle, some posts from the TypePad iPhone app.  Fred Wilson&#8217;s latest post about how his Blackberry is his own personal fountain pen has me inspired to do more off the cuff posting by email, but it&#8217;ll probably take me all year to get half as good at it as he is.</li>
<li>Goal for 2009: 365 days, 365 posts. There may be some days with one post, and some days with more, but I&#8217;d love to get back into that rhythm.  </li>
</ul>

<p>And <em>scene</em>.</p>
