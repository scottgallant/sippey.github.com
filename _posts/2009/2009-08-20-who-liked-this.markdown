<p>Dear Lazyweb,</p>

<p>Please give me a way -- a multi-tiered web application with a full JSON rest-based API, a little bookmarklet, a desktop widget, an iPhone app, a small little whatchmacallit, whatever, it doesn't matter -- to pull a list of the people who have "Liked" a particular article in Google Reader.  It will be much easier to build a canonical list of <s>idiots</s> really smart people that way.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Your pal,<br />
Michael</p>

<p>PS -- You're still out there, right?  You haven't moved to Facebook or something have you?  Do I need to start writing letters to "Dear LazyFacebook"?  Or "Dear LazyTwitter?"  Because that would be a drag.</p>

<p>PPS -- Yep, I actually signed it "Your pal." Admit it, you miss him too.</p>
