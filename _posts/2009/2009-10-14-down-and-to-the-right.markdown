<p>The New York Times covers "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/business/15exchange.html?ref=business">dark pools</a>" and other electronic exchange rivals to the NYSE, and shares this tidbit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, 36 percent of daily trades in stocks that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange are actually executed on the exchange, down from about 75 percent nearly four years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a massive change in behavior in four years.</p>
