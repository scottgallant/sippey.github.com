The American Prospect has a great <a href="http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=recognizing_jeanne_claude">appreciation of Jeanne-Claude</a>.

<blockquote>If Jeanne-Claude&#39;s portion of their work was in large part managing and bringing about the wrapping of the Pont Neuf in gold fabric despite then-Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac&#39;s grave hesitations, so much the better -- the process <i>is</i> the work. Jeanne-Claude&#39;s battle for recognition has helped shed light on the art world&#39;s discomfort with recognizing both women and the process behind creating large-scale work. That process was part of her work, too.</blockquote>
