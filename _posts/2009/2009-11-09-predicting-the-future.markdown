<p>I love this bit from Chris Dixon&#39;s <a href="http://cdixon.org/?p=1794">blog post announcing Founder Collective</a>.

</p><blockquote>We believe the best people to predict the future — and create it — are fellow entrepreneurs, not former bankers drawing graphs and developing abstract theses.</blockquote>
