<p>Via Curt Gardner's always fantastic reference, <a href="http://perival.com/delillo/delillo.html">Don DeLillo's America</a>, comes news of <em>Point Omega</em>, a <a href="http://perival.com/delillo/pointomega.html">new novel</a> due in February.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A young filmmaker visits the desert home of a secret war advisor in the hopes of making a documentary. The situation is complicated by the arrival of the older man's daughter, and the narrative takes a dark turn.</p>

<p>Documentaries, deserts, secret war advisors?  Yep, that's DeLillo alright.  </p>

<p>For the hardcores, here's the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Point-Omega-Novel-Don-DeLillo/dp/1439169950/">Amazon pre-order page</a>.  And as a reminder, Wikipedia describes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_point">Omega point</a> as...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A term invented by the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin to describe a maximum level of complexity and consciousness towards which the universe appears to be evolving.</p>
