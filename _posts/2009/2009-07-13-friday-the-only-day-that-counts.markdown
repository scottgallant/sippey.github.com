<p>In the context of <em>Bruno</em>, <em>Transformers</em>, <em>Up</em> and <em>The Hangover</em>, The Wrap has <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/article/summer-box-office-twitter-effect_4229">a piece up</a> about how the virulent nature of social media is changing movie marketing. Here's the relevant gem:</p>

<blockquote><p>The net effect, some studio executives say, is that a marketing spend that used to take a movie through the weekend now only really takes a studio through Friday evening, east coast time.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't entirely buy the argument that a marketing spend is <em>only</em> good through Friday; I imagine that a spend on launch hype for a flick will carry through to DVD / rental / online income in addition to ticket spend in theaters. But social media has to be having a massive impact on the half life of each marketing dollar.</p>

<p>And one small note -- I don't recall see a single ad for <em>Up</em> the weekend of its release...</p>
