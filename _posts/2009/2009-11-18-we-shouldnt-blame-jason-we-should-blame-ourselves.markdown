<p>Jason Kottke, on his <a href="http://kottke.org/09/11/cormac-mccarthy-interview">weblog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Before reading this interview, I didn&#39;t know much about [Cormac] McCarthy -- he&#39;s a fellow at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute#Resident_faculty">the Santa Fe Institute</a>? -- but now I think I need to read The Road. </blockquote>

<p>If this truly is the first time that Jason mothereffin Kottke has been interested in Cormac McCarthy than <strong>WE HAVE FAILED AS A NATION</strong>.</p>
