<p>Richard Lacayo on Shepard Fairey&#39;s <a href="http://lookingaround.blogs.time.com/2009/10/19/shepard-fairey-hopeless/">massive fuck up</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Judges really don&#39;t like it when you lie to the court and manufacture evidence.  And the real irony is that a lot of knowledgeable people who have been following this case thought Fairey had a good chance of winning no matter which photo his poster was based on, because he had  transformed the original image sufficiently to meet the fair-use test.</blockquote>
