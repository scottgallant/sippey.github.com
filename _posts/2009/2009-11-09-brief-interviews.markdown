<p>The Office&#39;s John Krasinski has written and directed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790627/#">a film adaptation</a> of David Foster Wallace&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brief-Interviews-Hideous-Men-Stories/dp/0316925411">Brief Interviews With Hideous Men</a>.  I had no idea.</p>

<p>Two quick notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Actually, I had no idea until learned about it <a href="http://lettersunknown.com/archives/001412.html">via the always helpful Ezra Cooper</a>, who writes that it &quot;can maybe best be described as a scarifying experience. Not redeptive, or cathartic, certainly, but more of a bracing shove.&quot;</li>
<li>If you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=brief+interviews+with+hideous+men&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Google the title</a>, the IMDB.com page for the film now outranks the Amazon.com page for the book.  Hooray for Hollywood!  (And for AMZN, obviously.)</li>
</ul>
