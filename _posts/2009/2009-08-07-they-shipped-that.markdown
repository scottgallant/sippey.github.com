<p>I&#39;m loving Andre&#39;s <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2009/08/android-software-day-3.html">posts about switching</a> from an iPhone to a Google phone, especially the highly opinionated bits like this one about Twidroid, the really awfully-named Twitter client for Android.</p>

<blockquote>There is a &quot;delete&quot; option for every tweet, not just my own, but every tweet. When you push that option you are told, &quot;You may not delete another users (sic) status&quot;. They shipped that. </blockquote>
