<p>Android v. iPhone is the new Windows v. Mac. Here&#39;s a representative comment on Stewart Alsop&#39;s post re. <a href="http://alsop-louie.com/gadgets/droid-doesnt-its-not-ready-for-prime-time/">the trouble he had with his Droid</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I’ve spent a lot of time with Android and it sounds to me like you don’t really understand what you’re doing or how the phone works.</blockquote>
