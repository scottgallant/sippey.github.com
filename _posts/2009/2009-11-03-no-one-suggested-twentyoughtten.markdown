<p>Big news <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/business/media/03adco.html?sudsredirect=true">in the Times</a> today about how car companies are choosing to pronounce "2010" in ads for new models.  (Shortcut: they're going for "two thousand ten" over "twenty ten".) Here's Jon Pearce, group creative director at <a href="http://www.teamone-usa.com/">Team One</a>, the agency for Lexus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Twenty ten feels a little slick, a little self-consciously futuristic. ...  There's nothing worse than trying to position -- or reposition, for that matter -- yourself with forced lingo."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because car companies have never used <a href="http://www.lexus.com/models/LS/features/interior/executiveclass_seating.html">slick</a>, <a href="http://www.lexus.com/models/LS/features/interior/lexus_enformtrade_with_safety_connecttrade.html">self-consciously futuristic</a> or <a href="http://www.lexus.com/models/LS/features/performance/adaptive_variable_air_suspension_avs.html">forced lingo</a> before.  So why start now.</p>
