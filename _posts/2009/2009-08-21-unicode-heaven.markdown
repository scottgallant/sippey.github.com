<p>With apologies to <a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/">Rex</a>, here's your new favorite site for the next five minutes: <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/unicode/#10051">Unicode table for you</a>, from <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/unicode-table.html">Paul Ford</a>.</p>

  <p>There may already be something like it out there, but I couldn't find anything quite like it, and I keep spending time poking around Unicode on Wikipedia and various other sites and finding it hard to get a sense of the whole range of options available.</p>

<p>This is my favorite, "heavy teardrop-spoked pinwheel": </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-size: 128px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial; line-height: 128px;">&#10051;</span></p>

<p>In exchange for the gift Paul gave the web with this page, you should go <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2630">vote up his panel</a> (well, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/08/17/click-my-lit-panel/">Zeldman's panel</a>, actually) at SxSW.  The gift economy at work!</p>
