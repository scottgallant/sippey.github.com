<p>Last night we watched <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">The Dark Knight</a></em> on Apple TV (it&#8217;s just as good the second time around), and noticed something new -- the aspect ratio occasionally switched from 2.4:1 (classic widescreen with the black bars) to 1.78:1 (which filled the entire display).  Turns out that the 1.78:1 shots (mostly action sequences) were filmed with IMAX cameras, and for the home video release (at least on Blu-Ray and AppleTV) they kept the aspect ratio intact for those scenes.  I guess we should have seen the movie in IMAX to begin with.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a long and involved <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1095138">thread at AV Science Forum about the aspect ratio switch on the BluRay release</a>, complete with a poll (&#8220;Should studios release movies with inconsistent aspect ratio switching?&#8221;).  (My take?  Yes.  It totally worked.)  And I&#8217;m sure this won&#8217;t be the last time we see this in action &#8212; Slashfilm had an item recently about Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan saying that <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/12/07/christopher-nolan-wants-to-go-full-imax-outlining-dark-knight-sequel/">he would love to shoot an entire feature with IMAX cameras</a>.</p>
