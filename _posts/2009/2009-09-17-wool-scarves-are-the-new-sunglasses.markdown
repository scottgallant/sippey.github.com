<p>Two art related bits from this morning's skim, both from New York Magazine...</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/09/ten_things_we_learned_at_chels.html">Ten things we learned from Chelsea's refreshed galleries</a>, including "wool scarves are the new sunglasses" (who knew!), red dots sometimes mean "not for sale" (as opposed to "sold," clever marketing), and this tidbit...</p>

  <p><strong>Artwork has shrunk</strong>. Lots of artists are doing work they — or their dealers — hope collectors will pick up, cash-and-carry, like candy bars at the supermarket checkout line. </p>

<p>And <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/09/madoff_art_stolen_again.html">Who keeps stealing Bernie Madoff's art?</a>  Did <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2009/01/just-who-are-the-educators.html">the educators</a> strike again?  Or did someone just pick it up, cash and carry (sans cash), like a candy bar at the supermarket checkout line?</p>
