<p><a href="http://hello.typepad.com/">David Jacobs</a> has been telling me that I absolutely have to read Bill Simmons&#39; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/034551176X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=statingtheobviou&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=034551176X">The Book of Basketball</a>; it&#39;s 700 pages long and Simmons <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4746227">post on ESPN.com</a> about the bits that <i>didn&#39;t</i> make it into the book are what&#39;s convincing me.</p>

<p>That, and grafs like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>A big theme of my book is The Secret of winning basketball, something Isiah Thomas explains to me at a topless pool in Las Vegas. (The Secret, in a nutshell: Teams only win titles when their best players forget about statistics, sublimate their own games for the greater good and put their egos on hold.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I like this Secret, and who wouldn&#39;t want to hear stories about Isiah Thomas in Vegas? There goes my holiday break...</p>
