<p>From <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/interview-apples-gigantic-new-data-center-hints-at-cloud-computing/14680">Cult of Mac</a> comes this nugget about Apple&#39;s cloud computing plans.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Apple is planning about 500,000 square feet of data center space in a single building,&quot; says Rich Miller, editor of Data Center Knowledge. &quot;That would place it among the largest data centers in the world... <strong>This would qualify as a big-ass data center</strong>.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
