<p>Edward Vielmetti has <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2009/12/stopped-watched-metadata.html ">an interesting take</a> on Ben Hammersley&#39;s post from yesterday re. metadata and publishing...</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Metadata only works when you un-meta it and deal with it again as data. </strong>&#0160;The list of metadata elements that I care enough to keep updating is not just meta; it&#39;s a first class real list, one that has to be treated as a first class citizen and not just some accidental system artifact. &#0160;</p></blockquote>

<p>Three points that have been rattling about in my head since reading Ben&#39;s and now Ed&#39;s post.</p>

<p>First, capturing and associating the metadata necessary for publishers needs to be <strong>as natural as possible</strong>. For a writer / journalist / blogger, or any type of content creator, that means that it not only needs to be part of the workflow, but it needs to actually <strong>add value</strong> to the piece they&#39;re creating.  Hyperlinks are a simple example of this; they can illustrate a point, add context for the reader, act as a punchline.  And annotating content with hyperlinks has become an easy and natural part of the writing process.</p>

<p>Second, workflow should focus on the things where humans add value; hyperlinks are obviously one, and <strong>non-obvious</strong> contextual tagging.  Let machines do the obvious stuff -- scanning  for proper nouns, place names, company names, addresses / locations, stock symbols, etc.</p>

<p>And third, as I&#39;ve pointed out a few times here, I think the biggest challenge will be integrating the social and the real-time into the digital magazine experience.  Clay Shirky made a great point at SxSW this year:  that basically <i>by definition</i> content that&#39;s more than about 500 words long is not about now.  So, what&#39;s the best way to connect content that was about <strong>then</strong> with a community experience that is about <strong>now</strong>?  And how can all this (meta)data help?</p>
