<p>"Ok hi, heh, ok heh. My name is b0xxy. Most of you know me as um oom ugh um most of you know me as b0xxy. I suppose if you're watching this you probably know me as b0xxy, but um ugh ugh most of you don't know me as moldy lunchbox..."</p>

<p>Andy Baio transcribes <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoP6HkxjS38">this b0xxy video</a> in the comment thread of <a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-5628.cfm">this post by Rex Sorgatz</a>. At least, it looks like Andy did it; maybe he outsourced it to <a href="http://waxy.org/2008/09/audio_transcription_with_mechanical_turk/">Mechanical Turk</a>? (<a href="http://boxxystory.blogspot.com/">More b0xxy context</a>, which I'm sure is <em>exactly</em> what you're looking for on inauguration eve.)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Andy points out in the comments that he pulled the transcription from <a href="http://encyclopediadramatica.com/B0xxy">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>. Which, you know, is sorta like Mechanical Turk.</p>
