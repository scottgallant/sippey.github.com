<p></p><blockquote><p>put time into whatever it is you like to do, and put that up on the web.</p>

<p>write about yourself, your hobbies, your passions, your politics, your community</p>

<p>whatever turns you on</p>

<p>because if you can be excited about them offline, and somehow transmit that enthusiasm online, or that depth of emotion over the wires<br />
people will find it and stay for it and check back in on it,<br />

<p>I&#39;ve been reading Scott Rosenberg&#39;s book <em>Say Everything</em> and going on a bit of a nostalgia trip. And while everything is still mostly <a href="http://www.carlsteadman.com">Carl&#39;s fault</a>, the great stuff that&#39;s happening in social media, blogs, etc., traces back to what Justin Hall said back in 1996.</p>
