<p>Yay, the Oscar nominations were announced!  Which means that Waxy's <a href="http://waxy.org/2009/01/pirating_the_2009_oscars/">annual survey of pirated Oscar-nominated films</a> is here as well!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Out of 26 nominated films, an incredible 23 films are already available in DVD quality on nomination day, ripped either from the screeners or the retail DVDs. This is the highest percentage since I started tracking.</p>
