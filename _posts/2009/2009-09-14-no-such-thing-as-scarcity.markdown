<p>Natasha Vargas-Cooper got <a href="http://madmenfootnotes.com/post/188023981/always-be-smoking-mad-men-footnotes-the-book">a book deal</a> out of her most excellent blog <a href="http://madmenfootnotes.com/">Footnotes of Mad Men</a> (congrats!), and, predictably, the comment thread at <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2009/09/natasha-vargas-cooper-sells-mad-men-book">The Awl</a> is full of great action, including this bit from Choire:</p>

<blockquote>I think most hating on book deals -- though there’s still plenty of valid book-deal-hating to do, believe me, and I intend to do some of it someday soon -- has to do with the idea of scarcity. There isn’t such a thing, really. Right now, in this world? Absolutely anyone can sell a book, if they want to put up with the pain in the ass of producing said book, which, ugh, is a pain in the ass.</blockquote>

<p>That lack of scarcity line -- especially in the context of book production -- is gonna stick with me for a while.</p>
