<p>Toby Barlow, whose book <em>Sharp Teeth</em> I <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/02/is-your-dog-a-w.html">blogged about</a> in early 2008, has a great <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/opinion/08barlow.html">piece in the Times</a> about what's happening in Detroit -- the land of $1000 houses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Detroit right now is just this vast, enormous canvas where anything imaginable can be accomplished. From Tyree Guyton’s Heidelberg Project (think of a neighborhood covered in shoes and stuffed animals and you’re close) to Matthew Barney’s “Ancient Evenings” project (think Egyptian gods reincarnated as Ford Mustangs and you’re kind of close), local and international artists are already leveraging Detroit’s complex textures and landscapes to their own surreal ends.</p>

  <p>In a way, a strange, new American dream can be found here, amid the crumbling, semi-majestic ruins of a half-century’s industrial decline. The good news is that, almost magically, dreamers are already showing up.</p>
