<p>Jeremy Denk (pianist, blogger) on the use of <a href="http://jeremydenk.net/blog/2009/12/10/schuberts-killer-abs/">Schubert in <em>Twilight: New Moon</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was one of these moments where Popular Culture decides for a capricious instant that Hundreds Of Years Of The Western Canon are temporarily useful for appropriation; it does classical music a huge favor by Noticing It. Lovers of classical music are supposed to beam and pant like a petted dog, grateful for any and all attention. Wag wag, woof woof, good boy, go play in your cute tuxedo now! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go read the whole thing. Even if you hate <em>Twilight</em> and have no idea who Schubert is.</p>
