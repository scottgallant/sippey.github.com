<p>Last night we were talking about the Olympic bid, and thinking through the calculus of Obama making the trip to Copenhagen for the final presentation... I was obviously naive in thinking that this had to be a bit like Bill Clinton heading to North Korea -- for someone of his stature to get on a plane, the deal had to already be in the bag.</p>

<p>Obviously not. As Peter Baker <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/sports/03obama.html?_r=1&amp;hp">puts it so succinctly</a> in his New York Times piece...</p>

<blockquote>Rarely has a president put his credibility on the line on the world stage in such a personal way and been slapped down so sharply in real time. </blockquote>

<p>Ouch.</p>
