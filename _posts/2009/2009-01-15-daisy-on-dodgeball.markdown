<p>Daisy Barringer <s>laments</s> celebrates <a href="http://oopsiedaisy.typepad.com/oopsie_daisy/2009/01/to-be-fair-i-hated-playing-it-in-gym-class-also.html">the demise of Dodgeball</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I do have one amazing story that would never have happened if not for Dodgeball. I was on a date with The Boy I&#39;m Not Dating many months ago, and he Dodgeballed our location. Minutes later, who showed up? His stalker ex-girlfriend. Fucking brilliant.</p></blockquote>
