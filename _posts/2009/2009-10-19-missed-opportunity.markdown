<p>One quick note on the&#0160;<a href="http://www.droiddoes.com/">DroidDoes</a> campaign: the whole site is built in Flash, which makes it completely unreadable on the iPhone. This fact may be some cute inside baseball play on the &quot;iDon&#39;t&quot; theme, but as a marketing tactic it&#39;s absolutely boneheaded. Dear Verizon: your campaign is a <em>meme</em>. You want it to <em>spread</em>. To people with <em>iPhones</em>.</p>
