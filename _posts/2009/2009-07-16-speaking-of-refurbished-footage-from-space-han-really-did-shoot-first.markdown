<p><blockquote><p>The original videos beamed to earth were stored on giant reels of tapes that each contained 15 minutes of video, along with 13 other channels of live data from the moon. In the 1970s and 1980s, NASA had a shortage of the tapes and erased about 200,000 of those tapes and reused them. That's apparently what happened to the famous moon landing footage.</p>
<p>Nafzger praised the restored work for its crispness. <strong>The restoration company, Lowry Digital of Burbank, Calif., also refurbished "Star Wars"</strong> and James Bond films, along with "Casablanca." </p></blockquote>
