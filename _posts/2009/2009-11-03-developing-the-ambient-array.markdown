<p>Do you love cities?  And architecture?  And computers?  And vague phrases like &quot;ambient arrays&quot; and &quot;biophysical mesh networks&quot; and &quot;knowable material&quot;?  Do you dress primarily in black?  Then chances are you could probably use Molly Steenson&#39;s new <a href="http://activesocialplastic.com/urbancomputing/">Urban Informatics Speech Title Generator</a> to help you brainstorm your next talk at that great conference where other lovers of biophysical mesh networks will gather.</p>

<p>Favorites of mine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussing the Playful Map</li>
<li>Activating the Physical Thing</li>
<li>Developing the Ambient Array</li>
</ul>
