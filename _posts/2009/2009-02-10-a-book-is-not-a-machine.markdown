<p><a href="http://www.edrants.com/">Edward Champion</a> is doing some amazing blogging from the O'Reilly Tools of Change conference.  <a href="http://www.edrants.com/tools-of-change-bob-stein-peter-brantley/">This particular post</a> about Peter Brantley's talk resonated with me -- even as I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daemon-Daniel-Suarez/dp/0525951113">a book about machines</a> on a <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=sippey+kindle">machine</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A book may be generated by a machine and ebooks may be available through machines, but that does not mean the book itself is a machine. Nor should the reader transform into a machine. This kind of perspective may work in programming circles, where jargon and other linguistic bullshit is tossed around as casually as spitballs. </p>
