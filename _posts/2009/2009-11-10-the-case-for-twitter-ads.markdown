<p>David Hornik makes <a href="http://ventureblog.com/articles/2009/11/monetizing_twitter_--_bring_on_the_ads.php">a compelling* argument</a> for Twitter to bring on the ads. Esp. of note is the graf about context...</p>

<blockquote>The very data others have suggested Twitter should sell to third parties is invaluable to create the necessary context for a successful advertising model.  Not only will Twitter know the things about which any given user is tweeting, it will also know who that user is following and the things about which they are tweeting.  That&#39;s a huge amount of context for advertisers.  I&#39;m guessing Toyota would love to advertise to an individual who tweets about shopping for a new Honda Hybrid.</blockquote>
