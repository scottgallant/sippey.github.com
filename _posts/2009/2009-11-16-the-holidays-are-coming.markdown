<p>...which is the perfect time to hole yourself up in your house, lock the door and watch all five seasons of The Wire back to back to back to back to back.  Whet your appetite with this superclip of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sgj78QG9Bg&amp;feature=autoshare">100 greatest lines from the series</a>, I&#39;m sure only available for a limited time. (<a href="http://dashes.com/anil/">via</a>)</p>

<p>My favorite in this bunch?  Omar.  &quot;Money ain&#39;t got no owners, only spenders.&quot;</p>
