<p>A brief note to the architect who designs the next airport in Las Vegas:  make it bigger.  The current McCarran airpot is way too small.  Not in terms of number of gates -- I'm not qualified to opine on whether this airport will need more gates.  It needs to be just simply, physically <em>bigger</em> so that it's in scale with the rest of Las Vegas.  You can't have a mall or a conference facility or a hotel that's 10x normal scale -- redwood-height ceilings, boulevard-width hallways, cavernous conference rooms, restaurants that seat thousands -- and have an airport that's merely "normal."  It's too jarring, the experience is way out of scale.  So at a minimum, the next version of McCarran needs to be at <strong>least</strong> as big as the United terminal at O'Hare. Preferably bigger.  Much bigger.</p>
