<p>If you follow along with the web 2.0 news, you've probably already seen <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/10/01/typepad-motion/">the headlines</a> that we introduced a couple of big things this week: the TypePad Platform and TypePad Motion.  Huge congrats are in order for the entire team...which was actually two teams working closely together:  the back-end team working on exposing key pieces of TypePad as a set of REST-based APIs, and the front-end team building a beautiful Django application for running simple, social connected communities that are powered by those TypePad APIs.  </p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="http://www.typepad.com/go/motion/">TypePad Motion</a>, join the <a href="http://developer.typepad.com/">developer program</a> and download the Django bits <a href="http://github.com/blog/510-typepad-developer-platform">from Github</a>.  But for the high level overview the blogs are where it's at:  Leah Culver has a <a href="http://blog.leahculver.com/2009/10/typepad-motion.html">great post about what the team built</a>, while <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2009/10/typepad-platform-and-typepad-motion.html">Chris Alden's post</a> puts all of this new stuff in broader Six Apart context.</p>

<p>I love working with this team, and bringing TypePad Motion to market -- with real sites running real software powering real communities -- has been a ton of fun.  There's a lot more to do, of course, but that's always the way it is when you launch a product.  Onwards!</p>
