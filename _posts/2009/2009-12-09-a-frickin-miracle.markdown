<p>Tim Goodman <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/12/09/DD0M1B0JLB.DTL">on Elvis Costello&#39;s Sundance Channel music show</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>There are a lot of elements that make &quot;Spectacle&quot; the best music show on television, but the most important litmus test is that you can tune in and either not know or not like the guest, only to find the hour flying by because Costello, like only a fellow musician could, manages to get stories out of them that others (think Jay Leno) could never do. <strong>He even got [Lou] Reed to laugh last season.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
