<p>From <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2009/08/michael-jackson-twitter.html">Sasha Frere-Jones at the New Yorker</a>, on the sentiment analysis of tweets re. the death of the Michael Jackson.</p>

<blockquote>It is reassuring that people are using “sad” correctly, though the paper reveals a less felicitous trend: thousands of people think that Michael is spelled “Micheal.” A study reveals that my degree of sadness surrounding this misspelling is 98.9%. (This was a double-blind study using an n of 1.)</blockquote>

<p>In my own personal experience, I&#39;ve discovered that many many people spell Michael &quot;S-I-P-P-E-Y&quot;, which is weird.</p>
