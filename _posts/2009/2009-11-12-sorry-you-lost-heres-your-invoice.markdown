<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jlxDCO3o2Lipkwnit2WjvF0TCa5gD9BU95T00">AP story reviewing the &quot;highlights&quot; of Sarah Palin&#39;s book</a> had this interesting bit:</p>

<blockquote>She reveals that about one-tenth of the $500,000 [in legal bills] was a bill she received to pay for the McCain campaign vetting her for the VP nod. She said when she asked the McCain campaign if it would help her financially, she was told McCain&#39;s camp would have paid all the bills if he&#39;d won; since he lost, the vetting legal bills were her responsibility.</blockquote>

<p>Wow. Really?</p>
