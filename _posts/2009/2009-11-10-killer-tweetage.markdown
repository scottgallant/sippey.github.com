<p>Ev's post <a href="http://evhead.com/2009/11/why-retweet-works-way-it-does.html">outlining the rationale for the implementation of RTs</a> in Twitter is full of interesting bits*, but this is the sentence that stuck out in the post.  Emphasis his:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This last point [re. unstructured data] is not obvious but is particularly important for fulfilling Twitter's goal of helping you <em>discover the information that matters most to you as quickly as possible.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the first time I've seen Twitter's goal stated that succinctly.  I Googled the phrase and scanned the Twitter website and couldn't find an occurrence of it before...did I miss it somewhere obvious?  I like it -- it's deep, wide and actionable.  And without being heavy-handed about it, it necessarily makes the acts of <em>contributing</em> to Twitter (tweeting, RTing, favoriting, following, listing) crucial inputs into the act of <em>discovering</em> on Twitter.  (Think: social filtering, preference mining, influence analysis, etc.)</p>

<p>Ev goes on to define the perfect Twitter; emphasis mine this time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The perfect Twitter would show you only the stuff you care about -- relevant, timely, local, funny, whatever you're most interested in -- <em>even if you don't follow the person who wrote it.</em> And, of course, it would give you ultimate, fine-grained control in how to do so. We want to give you more ways to help the good stuff bubble to the top.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is the perfect bookend to <a href="http://ventureblog.com/articles/2009/11/monetizing_twitter_--_bring_on_the_ads.php">David Hornik's post</a> this morning about Twitter and advertising.</p>

<p><small>* I have lots of opinions about commentless RTs, but am holding back until I've had a chance to experience them firsthand.</small></p>
