<p>I have a Cayce Pollard-sized crush on Lisbeth Salander, one of the main characters in Stieg Larsson&#39;s <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a></i>, yet I had no idea the book has already been made into a (Swedish) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/">film</a>.  Fred Wilson has all the <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/10/open-subtitles.html">instructions</a> on how he and his wife downloaded the movie and nabbed English subtitles from <a href="http://www.opensubtitles.org/">Open Subtitles</a>.  Project for next weekend...after I finish the book.</p>
