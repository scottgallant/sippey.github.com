<p>I love this new <a href="http://xoxco.com/clickable/random-reruns">experiment</a> from Ben Brown:   <a href="http://reruns.xoxco.com/">Random Reruns</a>.</p>

  <p>Making the leap from normal TV to internet TV means you lose the ability to just turn it on. In order to watch something on Hulu, even in the background, I have to search, sort, browse and select through thousands of choices. Do I want to watch a new episode of 30 Rock? Or maybe an old episode of He-man? It takes way too much thinking!</p>

<p>Put in your Hulu username, and Random Reruns will randomly serve up a show from your list of subscriptions.  I love anything that injects a little more randomness into the media diet.</p>
