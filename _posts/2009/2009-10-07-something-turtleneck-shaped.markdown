<p>Ben Hammersley <a href="http://benhammersley.com/2009/10/meandering-around-something-idea-shaped-but-not-quite-touching-it/">meanders around something idea-shaped</a> regarding cities and living in them, and &quot;the cushioning effect of history upon reference upon metaphor upon inter-mixed system.&quot;  And in the process he stumbles out a line that will stick with me for a <i>long time</i>.</p>

<blockquote>You don’t need to be Umberto Eco to riff off it for hours: it’s turtlenecks all the way down.</blockquote>

<p>OK, probably not exactly the bit of the piece that he wanted to have stick, but still, so good.</p>
