<p>Alison Byrne Fields&#39; post about <a href="http://wellknowwhenwegetthere.blogspot.com/2009/08/sincerely-john-hughes.html">being pen pals with John Hughes</a> is amazing.  I loved this bit that she quoted from one his letters to her, responding to news that her English teacher didn&#39;t appreciate her writing...</p>

<blockquote>As for your English teacher...Do you like the way you write? Please yourself. I&#39;m rather fond of writing. I actually regard it as fun. Do it frequently and see if you can&#39;t find the fun in it that I do.</blockquote>

<p>As the kids say, <strong>[this is good]</strong>.</p>
