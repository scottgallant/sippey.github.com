<p>There&#39;s been a metric ton of bits spilled on <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_demandmedia/all/1">content farms</a> lately; Paul Kedrosky <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/12/dishwashers_dem.html">blogs about the &quot;drive-by damage&quot;</a> this type of content has done as he tries to research a new washing machine.</p>

<blockquote><p>Google has become a snake that too readily consumes its own keyword tail. Identify some words that show up in profitable searches -- from appliances, to mesothelioma suits, to kayak lessons -- churn out content cheaply and regularly, and you&#39;re done. On the web, no-one knows you&#39;re a content-grinder. </p><p>The result, however, is awful. Pages and pages of Google results that are just, for practical purposes, advertisements in the loose guise of articles, original or re-purposed. It hearkens back to the dark days of 1999, before Google arrived, when search had become largely useless, with results completely overwhelmed by spam and info-clutter.</p></blockquote>
