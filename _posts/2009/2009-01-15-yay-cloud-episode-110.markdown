<p>Had my Macbook go poof on me this morning, and since there was a spare in the office, I was up and running again before lunch. &#0160;Mail via IMAP, address book and calendar sync&#39;d from MobileMe, etc. &#0160;The only thing that&#39;s taking real time is moving photos and music from one machine to the other; I&#39;m not quite ready to give up on local storage for those.</p>
