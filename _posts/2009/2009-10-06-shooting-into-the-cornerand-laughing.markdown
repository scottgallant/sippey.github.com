<p>Holy crap I love <a href="http://www.anishkapoor.com/">Anish Kapoor</a>.  Go check out the video and photographs for <a href="http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/2009/10/07/shooting-into-the-corner/">Shooting into the Corner</a> at today and tomorrow.  There's such great richness behind the "cannon," the red wax, the context of the gallery, the artist as the person behind the trigger...not to mention that it creates a damned beautiful installation.</p>

<p>Watch the video all the way through -- not only for the payoff of the cannon actually firing, but the nervous laughter that follows from the unseen art lovers in the gallery.  For me, their laughter triggered the same vaguely uncomfortable feeling I had when hearing Letterman's audience laugh at his sex-with-staffers admission: you know it's the "wrong" reaction, but that if you were in their place you'd do the exact same thing.</p>
