<p>Long time <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/01/five-wishlist-i.html">readers</a> won't be surprised to learn that I'm seriously considering installing the beta of iPhone v3 for one single feature alone -- landscape mode in Mail, Notes and SMS.  Like many others, I can probably count on three fingers the number of times I've missed not having copy &amp; paste, but every single day there are two fat thumbs that long to romp through the landscape.</p>

<p>Other misc notes on v3:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Matt Jones is <a href="http://magicalnihilism.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/iphone-30-everyware-ready/">right on the money</a> -- the hardware integration stuff is big news, and an area that's wide open for crazy innovation in all sorts of verticals.</p></li>
<li><p>Mmmm, push notification services.  I didn't see any news mentions of developer pricing for that, so I assume they didn't discuss it.  This is something to watch:  ESPN delivering sports scores is one thing (there are a limited number of sporting events in a year)...messaging apps are another.  The use case of real-time messaging notifications (Twitter DMs, IM alerts, etc.) is going to be an interesting one from a pricing perspective, since the volume and timing of those are, by definition, out of the application developer's control.</p></li>
<li><p>In-app purchases are also going to be very interesting from a pricing and user behavior perspective.  In their conversation at SxSW, Chris Anderson and Guy Kawaski touched on the psychology of charging even $0.01 v. giving things away for free, and the mental transaction cost involved in making the decision to pay <em>more than zero</em> for an item.  The context for that conversation was "the web," so we'll see if the context of "the bright shiny phone" changes that at all.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm assuming that a developer could use the in app purchase mechanism to sell a subscription or bundle of push notification messages.  App developers are going to have to get savvy about pricing and business models -- the guys at <a href="http://www.pinchmedia.com/">Pinch Media</a> have to be <em>loving</em> all the things they heard yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm frankly surprised by the iPod library access APIs -- I'm imagining a whole new slew of UIs for browsing and playing and interacting with your own media.  Paul Lamere showed some cool music library visualization stuff from Sun's <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=153">Search Inside the Music</a> project at SxSW -- I'd love to see some of that work / thinking end up on a pocket-sized multitouch display.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Until all that stuff surfaces, though, I'm gonna be happy with my landscaped keyboard.  Because on my phone, I'm all thumbs.</p>
