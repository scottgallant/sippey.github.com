<p>Hey, New York friends -- this looks like fun:  <a href="http://www.cutandpaste.com/events/global_championship/">2009 Global Cut &amp; Paste Championship</a> at the Hammerstein Ballroom this Friday night October 16th.</p>

<blockquote> With the broad geographical reach of an Olympic event and the nervy psychological gamesmanship of the X Games, the championship takes the tournamentâ€™s international approach to design as spectator sport and amps it up like never before.</blockquote>

<p>More &quot;design as spectator sport,&quot; please.</p>
