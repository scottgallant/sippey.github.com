<p>Ahhh, <a href="http://blockchalk.com/">I like this</a>.</p>

<blockquote>BlockChalk is the voice of your neighborhood.&#0160; You can use it to talk to anyone, about anything.&#0160; It’s like a virtual graffiti wall, a community bulletin board, and a poster-covered lightpost, all rolled into one.&#0160; Using the GPS in your iPhone, it shows you messages that other people have left at the place you’re standing, and it lets you leave your own messages, too.&#0160; It’s anonymous unless you decide to share more.&#0160; You can even privately reply to other users while still remaining anonymous.</blockquote>

<p>Simple.</p>
