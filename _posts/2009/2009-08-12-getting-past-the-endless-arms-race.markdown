<p>Via <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2009/08/12/random-acts-of-design-kindness">subtraction.com</a> comes this great post from Jeff Howard at Design for Service about <a href="http://designforservice.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/the-problem-with-service-design/">the endless arms race</a> of quality v. customer expectations...</p>

<blockquote><p>I pretty much expect FedEx never to lose my package. In fact, I expect overnight delivery to anywhere in the world. How crazy is that? Itâ€™s taken fewer than 30 years for something magical to become a commonplace.</p>
<p>At what point do we hit the wall with services? Are they ever actually good enough, or is it an endless arms race against mediocrity and commoditization?</p></blockquote>

<p>Howard&#39;s proposed solution -- unpredictability and &quot;random acts of kindness&quot; -- makes sense to me, esp. when looking at service design through the lens of brains-as-pattern-recognition machines.  If the brain doesn&#39;t recognize the pattern, it pays attention.  <i>(Jeff Hawkins&#39; book <a href="http://www.onintelligence.org/">On Intelligence</a> should be required reading for product and service designers, IMHO.)</i>  The challenge is finding just the right pattern breaker that pleasantly surprises and is cost- and operationally-effective to deliver.</p>
