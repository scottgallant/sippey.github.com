<p>I found this <a href="http://cdixon.org/?p=1293">great blog post</a> by Chris Dixon via Twitter.</p>

<blockquote>The core services built on top of the internet – the web (HTTP), email (SMTP), subscription messaging (RSS) – were made similarly open and therefore distributible across institutions.&#0160; This explains their remarkable system-wide reliability. &#0160;It also explains why we should be worried about reliability when core internet services are owned by a single company.</blockquote>
