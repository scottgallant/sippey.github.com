<p>Anil has two really great and non-obvious points for developers in his post <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/12/the-twitter-api-is-finished.html">The Twitter API is Finished</a>.  First, support RSD (yes!).  Second, overload the source element.</p>

<blockquote><p>The source element of status updates in the Twitter API is very interestingly open-ended, and supports use of URLs. Instead of merely advertising your client app, smart use of rel attributes and URLs here could help bootstrap some very interesting new potential.</p></blockquote>
