<p>I have no idea what <i>Clash of the Titans</i> is even about, but thanks to <a href="http://oofblamargh.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/second-awesome-clash-of-the-titans-trailer-leaks-out-early-firstshowingnet.html">rhbaby&#39;s description of the just-pulled but just-before-that-leaked second trailer</a> for the movie, now I have to see it.</p>

<blockquote><p>The trailer got pulled, so below is an artist
representation. First Zeus was all &quot;Mortals suck!&quot; and he would have
thrown down some of the lightning - WHOOSHCRASH! - except he didn&#39;t.
Then we saw a glimpse of Pegasus and that rocked, and there was some
dude with a sword and he was all &quot;Mortals don&#39;t suck!&quot; and he ran some
places, jumped around and then was all &quot;WTF!? GIANT GODDAMN FUCKING
SCORPIONS!!1!&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>I won&#39;t ruin the artist representation; <a href="http://oofblamargh.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/second-awesome-clash-of-the-titans-trailer-leaks-out-early-firstshowingnet.html">click through</a> for yourself.</p>
