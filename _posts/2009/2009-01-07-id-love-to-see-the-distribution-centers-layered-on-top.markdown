<p>Via Gizmodo (which means you’ve probably all seen this already, unless you’ve tuned them out for the duration of CES lest you suffer from the disastrous combination of the shinies and end-of-days ennui) comes this wonderful animated map from <a href="http://projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/">Flowing Data</a> that plots the <s>spread</s> growth of Wal-Mart from 1964 to the present. Be sure to zoom in for full effect.</p>
