<p>If you haven&#39;t seen last night&#39;s Mad Men ep, I don&#39;t think this (from Tim Goodman&#39;s <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/tgoodman/detail?blogid=24&amp;entry_id=49367">morning recap</a>) is much of a spoiler.</p>

<blockquote>And I suspect at least part of the exchange - the dismissive &quot;you people&quot; - was Weiner&#39;s way of reaffirming the idea that Don is not really a likable character (as David Chase had to do periodically with Tony on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;), as Don&#39;s cult of cool (good looks, great job, available women, constant drinking) begins to look pretty interesting from the couch. </blockquote>

<p>I had the exact same thought last night.  Weiner needs the audience to keep Don at arm&#39;s length...and that scene last night was the M.M. equivalent of Tony beating some guy&#39;s head in with a baseball bat.</p>
