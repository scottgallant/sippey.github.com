<p>The Berkeley Art Museum is hosting a <a href="http://bcnm.berkeley.edu/tvfuneral/">Funeral for Analog TV</a> on Tuesday, February 17 with Bruce Sterling and Paul Saffo.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Analog Television has not been a good friend to us all, it has been important to each and every one of us. Analog Television is survived by its wife Digital Television, and its second cousin Internet Television. In a soap-operatic melodrama fit for TV itself, Congress has debated changing the official date for the switch to digital television; however this event will proceed on Feb. 17 because we prefer to bury a fresh corpse rather than wait for the walking dead to fall over.</p>
