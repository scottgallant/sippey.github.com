<p>I'm a compulsive saver of links.  Links I save for no particular reason other than their general greatness I tag on delicious as <a href="http://delicious.com/msippey/thisisgood">thisisgood</a>.  Here are five recent ones.  If they're not new to you, then you can derisively snicker "seen it" and move right along.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://badgods.com/forumville-riddance.html">I'm leaving forumville forever.  Discuss.</a>  </li>
<li>Ezra Cooper on the job of being a <a href="http://lettersunknown.com/archives/001317.html">production assistant on The Shining</a>.  "KUBRICK: No! Keep typing!" (There, I've spoiled the punchline.  You'll have to clickthrough for the setup.)</li>
<li>A fantastic Talk thread at Serious Eats:  <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/talk/2009/04/what-do-you-collect.html">What do you collect</a>?  There's the usual lists of course (fiestaware, hot sauces, etc.) but also a few gems like this one:  "I think I have the world's largest collection of grasshopper pins."</li>
<li>Flowing Data on <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2009/04/21/visual-representation-of-tabular-information-how-to-fix-the-uncommunicative-table/">how to fix the uncommunicative table</a>.  I have no idea if those circles are actually a fix, but wow, they sure are pretty.</li>
<li>And, finally, I know, everyone's into Fuck You, Penguin.  But I really loved the one about how <a href="http://fuckyoupenguin.blogspot.com/2009/04/egotistical-deer-think-they-are-always.html">Egotistical deer think they are always making your day</a>.  "It's really because deer are huge attention whores."</li>
</ol>
