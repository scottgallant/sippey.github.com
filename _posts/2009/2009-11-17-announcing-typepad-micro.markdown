<p><a href="http://www.sharondawoodfin.net/">Sharonda Woodfin</a> has a great post about what we&#39;re up to with TypePad...</p>

<blockquote><p>TypePad has made a lot of changes over the past year, but the one that&#39;s coming next will be the biggest of them all! SixApart is rolling out a whole new, free-of-charge level of TypePad service: TypePad Micro!</p></blockquote>

<p>Posted here thanks to TypePad&#39;s new reblog feature. (You should try it yourself!) Huge congrats to the TypePad team...</p>
