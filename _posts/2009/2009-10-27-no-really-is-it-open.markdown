<p><a href="http://isthebaybridgeopen.com/">Is the Bay Bridge open?</a> is a single-serving-site I put up tonight.  Please note that you should not rely on this site for <i>actual</i> information about the state of the Bay Bridge.</p>

<p>Also, has anyone else noticed the irony in the fact that the first name of the Bay Bridge spokesperson is <i>Bart</i>?</p>
