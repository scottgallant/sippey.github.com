<p><em>Caveat: I recognize that this is totally half-baked, but am optimizing for speed over fully-bakedness.</em></p>

<p>So there&#8217;s the requisite amount of noise today on <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=itunes+upgrade&amp;scoring=d">blogs</a> &amp; <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=itunes+upgrade">Twitter</a> about the price tag for &#8220;upgrading&#8221; your library to non-DRM&#8217;d music.  Freedom-loving music buyers are directing <a href="http://twitter.com/cshirky/status/1100990824">ire</a> at Apple for double dipping &#8212; charging them again for the tracks they&#8217;ve already paid for.</p>

<p>Leave aside for a moment whether said freedom-loving music buyer is in the right. That argument isn&#8217;t worth having.) Instead, let&#8217;s look at this a bit differently: <strong>what if the iTunes music store had been architected like the App Store?  Where would the ire be directed then?</strong></p>

<p>In the App Store, Apple&#8217;s &#8220;just&#8221; a channel, the host of the bazaar.  When you buy an app, you buy from the developer, and they&#8217;re the ones that not only build the product, but set the price and do the marketing.  And this means that when Apple comes along with iPhone 3.0 software, or a new device form factor, or even just some new feature that necessitates a new version of the app, the developer is the one who makes the decision about whether or not to charge the user for that new version.</p>

<p>And in the music store, Apple&#8217;s a more classic retailer &#8212; the manufacturer of the product (in this case the label, and yes, I know that&#8217;s the bug here) isn&#8217;t as important as the label on the product (artist name) or the retailer itself.  The analogy isn&#8217;t quite parallel, obviously, but posit for a minute for that the ability to sell DRM-free music is a new &#8220;feature&#8221; of the platform, and that the content on that platform needed to be upgraded to take advantage of that new feature.  Since the manufacturer / label is subjugated to the retailer / Apple, the decision to charge users an additional $0.30 per track for the upgrade appears to consumers to be Apple&#8217;s decision, regardless of whatever boardroom negotations had to happen to reach the place where they could offer this service.</p>

<p>I know there are a ton of historical reasons why the music store doesn&#8217;t work like the App Store (major labels, RIAA, fear, doubt, greed, ego, etc.).  But the difference in the way the App Store works couldn&#8217;t be starker &#8212; they provide a valuable service (distribution, discovery, promotion and integration), extract rents for that service (30%), and then get out of the way. (Well, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/09/app_store_exclusion">sorta</a>.)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the point (finally!):  if the music store worked like the App Store, the ire of the freedom-loving music buyer wouldn&#8217;t be directed at Apple today; instead it would be directed at the labels who chose to charge their listeners to convert the music they&#8217;ve already paid for into a format they should have offered from day one.</p>
