<blockquote><strong>Don’t think of it as a movie – it’s a mega abstract conceptual art project at a bargain</strong>. I paid $7.50 to see a film that cost $150 million to make. There are few bargains this good. By not thinking of it as a movie the pressure to have it make sense went away, and the cheezy jokes, cardboard cutout characters,&#0160; or racial stereotypes didn’t bother me. Instead my mind was free to wonder how many people were in charge of<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1083271/"> Megan Fox’s</a> lip gloss. Or the conversations the CGI folks must have had about how a functioning robot that walks and gets hit by grenades and tank shells could convert in seconds into a functioning jet.</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like a useful strategy beyond Michael Bay films; it could be employed in any number of situations.  It&#39;s not a long, boring, interminable meeting / email thread / PowePoint / presentation / legal document...it&#39;s an abstract conceptual art project!</p>
