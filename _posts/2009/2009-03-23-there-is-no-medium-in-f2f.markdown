<p>Meetup founder <a href="http://scott.heiferman.com/notes/2009/03/listening.html">Scott Heiferman's note</a> on the KCET piece <a href="http://kcet.org/socal/2009/03/is-anybody-listening.html">Is Anybody Listening</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does it take a camera to get people to tell their story? People looking at camera, people looking at screen. There's an odd, passive aversion to actual, vulnerable human f2f confrontation. People telling their story to other people is infinitely scalable. F2F conversation &amp; story-sharing is the most powerful medium. (Not really a medium -- nothing in "the middle".)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just nabbing this excerpt of Scott's note is a bit unfair; his first point on <em>Is Anybody Listening</em> is "Great piece".  </p>
