<p>Rich Juzwiak is back doing <a href="http://fourfour.typepad.com/fourfour/2009/10/the-trolls-have-eyes.html">only what he can do</a> to America&#39;s Next Top Model.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll keep saying it until <em>you&#39;re</em> blue in the face from telling me to shut up:  even if you don&#39;t watch the show (especially if you don&#39;t watch the show) you should be reading <a href="http://fourfour.typepad.com/">fourfour</a>.</p>
