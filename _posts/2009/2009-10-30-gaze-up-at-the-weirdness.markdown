<p>Rich <a href="http://fourfour.typepad.com/fourfour/2009/10/this-is-it-and-thats-that.html">Juzwiak on Michael</a> Jackson.</p>

<blockquote>He was the kind of man who thought audiences would be &quot;nourished&quot; by the reinsertion of eight bars of &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; into its live arrangement, the kind of man who considered &quot;love is important,&quot; to be an &quot;important&quot; message to convey in his show, the kind of man who would wear a blazer with cartoonishly pointed shoulders over a T-shirt depicting an iced-out Popeye. It was a man so mired in weirdness, he had no idea how weird he was (I&#39;ll never forget the astonished way he asked Martin Bashir, &quot;You don&#39;t climb trees?!?&quot;). Except now, instead of rolling our eyes at that weirdness, we gaze up at it and sigh. It took a lot for us to come around, but I&#39;m glad we did.</blockquote>
