<p>Via Donn Zaretsky&#8217;s <a href="http://theartlawblog.blogspot.com/">Art Law Blog</a>, this news great news story that I somehow missed on New Year&#8217;s:  a copper statue valued at $10,000 <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/01/national/main4695071.shtml">was stolen from Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Palm Beach home</a>, and then returned with an attached note.</p>

<blockquote>
&#8220;Bernie the Swindler, Lesson: Return stolen property to rightful owners. Signed by - The Educators.&#8221;
</blockquote>

<p>The story at CBSnews.com was illustrated with a photo of the statue (unremarkable, frankly) and one of Madoff&#8230;but unfortunately not of the note itself.  <em>That&#8217;s</em> what I wanted to see&#8230;along with an in-depth profile of The Educators, of course.</p>

<p>Also, I kind of got one of those frightened kicks out of the fact that Zearetsky linked back to me in his latest <a href="http://theartlawblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/meet-mr-pareto.html">round up post on deaccessioning</a>; I&#8217;m an observant sideliner and the fact that I&#8217;m still undecided doesn&#8217;t mean much.  Nothing to see here, move right along.</p>
