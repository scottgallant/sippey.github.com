<p>The money quote from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/yahoo-got-binged/">Erick Schonfeld&#39;s piece</a> on Yahoo and Microsoft.</p>

<blockquote>This is a ten-year arrangement between two lumbering giants that is filled with execution risk.  It is a very complicated deal.  Yahoo’s sales team has enough trouble communicating with its own engineers.  Now they have to learn how to talk to Microsoft’s.</blockquote>
