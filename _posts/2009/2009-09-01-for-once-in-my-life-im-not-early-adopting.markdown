<p>So yeah, I think I&#39;ll hang back on that <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/177715198/confessional">Snow Leopard thing for a bit</a>.  I&#39;ve bought it, of course, but I&#39;ll wait until all my super early adopter friends with their five machines and their Macports and their virtualenvs and their tricked out Quicksilver installs get things working right.  Then I&#39;ll pull the trigger.</p>

<p>Until then, you can call me laggard boy.</p>
