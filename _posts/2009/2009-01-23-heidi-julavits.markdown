<p>Nice <a href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/stray-questions-for-heidi-julavits/">mini-interview with novelist Heidi Julavits</a> in the Times' Paper Cuts blog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Whose books are shelved around yours in bookstores? How does it feel to be sitting between them?</strong></p>

  <p>I’m frequently shelved between Joyce and Kafka, and I’m trying to take aesthetic cues from this sandwiching — I’m writing lyrically maximal allegories about the absurdly doomed human condition of pregnant ladies at bath house raves.</p>
