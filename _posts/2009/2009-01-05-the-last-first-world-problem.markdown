<p>This has to be the ultimate[1] definition of &#8220;first world problem:&#8221;  Matt (as in &#8220;where the hell is&#8221;) Harding had to book two zero-gravity plane flights to film a snippet for his <a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.typepad.com/blog/">ongoing project</a> because on the first one <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/the-perils-of-zero-gravity-videography/">his hard drive-based camcorder failed</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
Like all modern hard drives, the Sony SR1’s hard drive has a drop-detection system. When it thinks it’s falling, the hard drive heads park themselves to prevent damage upon impact.  Unfortunately, in zero gravity, the camcorder always thinks it’s falling.

<p>[1] &#8220;Ultimate&#8221; in both senses of the word, because from here on out all problems identified as first world problems will be judged against this one.</p>
