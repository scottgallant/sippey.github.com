<p>A chat from this morning, prompted by the <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2009/12/apple-lala.html">apple + lala</a> post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>friend:</strong> Spotify just needs to launch in the US<br />
  <strong>me:</strong> or i need to move to the uk<br />
  <strong>friend:</strong> I can't believe somebody hasn't figured out an ec2/europe proxy thing for it yet<br />
  <strong>me:</strong> someone probably has. and they're just keeping it to themselves and their friends.<br />
  <strong>friend:</strong> ask on twitter? :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, has anyone done this?  An persistent EC2-based proxy that gets US users into Spotify? (If I were really motivated I guess I could use <a href="http://sprayfly.com/2009/06/28/shell-script-for-automated-amazon-ec2-personal-proxy-server/">this post on how to create a personal proxy server on EC2</a> as a guide...)</p>
