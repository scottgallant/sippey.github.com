<p>At Today and Tomorrow, <em><a href="http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/2009/12/04/unstilled-stills/">Unstilled Stills</a></em> by Laura Brothers; animated GIF interpretations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyfford_Still">Clyfford Still</a> paintings. Amazing.</p> 

<p><small>(Which reminds me of this San Francisco Art Institute MFA show that we saw once where one of the grad students' work was clearly "inspired" by Still, and one of the visiting art lovers had written in the artist's guest book something to the effect of "I represent Clyfford Still's estate and I'll see you in court." These animated GIFs are nothing like those rip-off paintings.)</small></p>
