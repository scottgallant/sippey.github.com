<p>Last Tuesday night, after Caltrans closed the Bay Bridge for repairs, I set up a single serving site:  <a href="http://isthebaybridgeopen.com/">isthebaybridgeopen.com</a>, and then proceeded to pimp it lightly here and on Twitter.  </p>

<p>Just because I find this kind of stuff interesting, here's a quick summary of visitor traffic and activity.  The data here is from Tuesday night through "now" (or whatever Google Analytics defines as "now"):</p>

<ul>
<li>2,756 visits / 3,285 pageviews</li>
<li>45 comments, or 1 comment for every 73 pageviews</li>
<li>48 tweets, or 1 tweet for every 68 pageviews</li>
<li>This was a local story, so the vast majority of the visits were from California</li>
<li>45% of visits were direct, 55% were clicks from referring sites</li>
</ul>

<p>And the top ten referring sites were...</p>

<ol>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>SFist</li>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Planet.mozilla.org</li>
<li>Baybridgeblog.org</li>
<li>mobile.SFist.com</li>
<li>oduinn.com</li>
<li>sippey.com (hey, that's me!)</li>
<li>bayarearidersforum.com</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously this wasn't a huge viral hit.  But it was a fun little $15 / 15 minute project.  And in case you hadn't heard, <a href="http://isthebaybridgeopen.com/">the Bay Bridge is now open</a>.</p>
