<p>I liked the Smashing Magazine post about &quot;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-death-of-the-blog-post/">the death of the boring blog post</a>.&quot;  While I tend to lean on the side of &quot;good content makes for good blog posts, regardless of format,&quot; it&#39;s nice to be reminded that a well thought out design of an individual post can make for good content. (Cue oldtimer voice:  it&#39;s the way the web used to look -- back when things were <i>hand-crafted</i>.)</p>

<p>Having said that*, if we end up with a bunch of &quot;top ten tricks to [insert your productivity thing here]&quot; posts that have really big titles, background images and custom-styled ordered list elements, those posts will <i>still</i> be boring.</p>

<p><small>* Yep, Curb reference.</small></p>
