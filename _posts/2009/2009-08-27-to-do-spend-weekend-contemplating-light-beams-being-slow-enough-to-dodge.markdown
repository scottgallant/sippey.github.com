<p>I really wish John Scalzi hadn&#39;t used the phrase &quot;Epic FAIL&quot; in the title of his <a href="http://blogs.amctv.com/scifi-scanner/2009/08/bad-designs-in-star-wars.php">piece about technology and design in Star Wars</a>. Because otherwise it&#39;s fun reading, in a &quot;yeah, I know, it is sad that I&#39;m simultaneously (a) nodding in agreement, (b) finding it funny and (c) picking which bit to blog about&quot; kind of way.</p>

<p>For the record, here&#39;s the bit I picked.</p>

<blockquote>A tactical nightmare: They&#39;re incredibly loud, especially for firing what are essentially light beams. The fire ordnance is so slow it can be dodged, and it<strong> </strong>comes out as a streak of light that reveals your position to your enemies. Let&#39;s not even go near the idea of light beams being slow enough to dodge; that&#39;s just something you have let go of, or risk insanity.</blockquote>

<p>So for the weekend it&#39;s either contemplate light beams slow enough to dodge, or unpack the rules of <a href="http://paytonij.wikispaces.com/Eschaton">Eschaton</a>. Either way -- insanity.</p>
