<p>Reason #4789, our IT manager sends out fantastic holiday gift ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>To:</strong> Six Apart SF Office<br />
  <strong>Subject:</strong> Cruel Like Me<br />
  If you have a Mac lover in the family and a cruel streak, I have lots of spare Macbook Pro boxes you can take to pack your non-Macbook Pro gifts in. Stop by and grab one.  My daughter is going to get one just FILLED with socks.</p>
