<p>I'm fascinated by this "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/02/12/us.russia.satellite.crash/index.html?iref=mpstoryview">satellites collide</a>" story -- it's an easy way to avoid thinking about things like collapsing markets and stimulus packages.  This quote from US Strategic Command is perfect:  "Space is getting pretty crowded. The fact that this hasn't happened before -- maybe we were getting a little bit lucky."  The European Space Operations Center has some <a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC/SEMN2VM5NDF_mg_1.html">nice visualizations</a> of the trackable objects around the planet.</p>
