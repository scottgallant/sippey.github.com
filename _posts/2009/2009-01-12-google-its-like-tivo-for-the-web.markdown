<p>How many pitches have you heard where the product was destined to be “TiVo for the Web?” <em>(Hint: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tivo%20for%20the%20web%22">Google says</a> about 7,300. Your number may vary.)</em> Now TiVo doesn’t want to be TiVo for television, but instead the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/01/tivo-redesigns.html">Google of TV</a>.</p>

<p>So now, if you want to pitch your idea as TiVo for the web, be prepared to turn your product into Google for the web, which, you know, already exists.</p>
