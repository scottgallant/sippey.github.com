<p><p>This is unreal.  <a href="http://www.samplereality.com/2009/07/16/david-foster-wallace-don-delillo-and-the-littlest-literary-hoax/">Sample Reality</a> reports on a review of David Foster Wallace's <i>Oblivion</i> by none other than Jay Murray Siskind, a character from Don DeLillo's <i>White Noise</i> and <i>Amazons</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Jay Murray Siskind is Don DeLillo’s only recurring character, having first appeared in DeLillo’s pseudonymous <span id="apture_prvw27" class="aptureLink "><span class="aptureLinkIcon" style="background-position: 100% -1649px; ">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.perival.com/delillo/amazons.html" class="aptureLink snap_noshots"><span>Amazons</span></a></span> and later as a kind of Mephistopheles character in <span id="apture_prvw1" class="aptureLink "><span class="aptureLinkIcon" style="background-position: 100% -1349px; ">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R11CAI" class="aptureLink snap_noshots">White Noise</a></span>. Now, Siskind has broken out of the realm of fiction and entered the real world.</p>
<p>I am referring to “An Undeniably Controversial and Perhaps Even Repulsive Talent,” a review of David Foster Wallace’s work that appeared in the prestigious journal <em>Modernism/Modernity</em>, published by The Johns Hopkins University Press. Found in the Volume 11, Number 4 issue (2004) of <em><a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/modernism-modernity/v011/11.4siskind.html">Modernism/Modernity</a>, </em>the review focuses on Wallace’s last collection of short stories,&nbsp;<span id="apture_prvw2" class="aptureLink "><span class="aptureLinkIcon" style="background-position: 100% -1349px; ">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC1RGE" class="aptureLink snap_noshots">Oblivion</a></span>, and is attributed to a certain Jay Murray Siskind, Department of Popular Culture, Blacksmith College.</p>
