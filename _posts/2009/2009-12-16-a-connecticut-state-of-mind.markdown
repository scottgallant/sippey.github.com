<blockquote><p>I love New York, king of all the cities<br />
Lived up by the Guggenheim 'til I got some kiddies<br />
Moved to Connecticut, bye George Pataki<br />
Volvo to the dry cleaners, pickin' up my khakis<br />
Shopping mall is close, my community is gated<br />
My shorties are all private school educated<br />
Home theater system, 60 inch plasma<br />
Clean suburban air much better for my asthma<br />
Still hit the city, Times Square keep it real<br />
Hard Rock Cafe for the appetizer deal<br />
M&M store, Disney Store, I'm in heaven<br />
I own this town from 41st to 47<br />
Tickets to the Lion King, that show is fantastic<br />
Leave half an hour early so I can beat the traffic<br />
I can get home really fast drive my rock some EasyPass<br />
Land of cheaper gas and the upper middle class</p></blockquote>

<p>...but I'm sure I got some wrong. Corrections welcome in the comments.</p>
