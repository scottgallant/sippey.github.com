<p><blockquote>We still call CDs record <i>albums</i>, even though very little has been released in album form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record#Record_albums">since the days of 78s</a> almost sixty years ago.   I'd say it'll be around for a while, since there's no better word to replace it with yet.   "Recorded" is too generic; you could mean audio only, depending on the context.  I'd say even worse than that, when I take my videocamera someplace, I'm <i>filming</i> what's going on.  I've been trying to think of things which <i>have</i> successfully been replaced by modern versions of the word, but I'm coming up short.</blockquote>
