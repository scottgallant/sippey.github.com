<p>Steve Reich <a href="http://newmusicbox.com/article.nmbx?id=5958">won</a> the 2009 Pulitzer prize in Music for <em>Double Sextet</em>.  This makes me insanely happy, and just heightens the anticipation for <a href="http://www.eighthblackbird.com/">eighth blackbird's</a> upcoming recording.  Until that arrives you can listen to an <a href="http://www.carnegiehall.org/article/sound_insights%5Cworks%5Ccommissions%5Cart_detail_DoubleSextet_commissions.html">excerpt</a> at Carnegie Hall's website, or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IqVnvkzvNQ&amp;feature=channel_page">watch</a> eighth blackbird's first rehearsal of the piece on YouTube.  Reich was interviewed for NPR's All Things Considered <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103295578">this afternoon</a>; he was typically gracious.</p>
