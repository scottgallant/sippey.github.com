<p>Andrew Sullivan <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/01/sorry-no-detail.html">on his talk with Obama</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  Lots of emails from readers asking about the chat with the president-elect this morning. It was totally off the record and I&#8217;m a stickler for those rules. I can say, however, the following: it&#8217;s hard to express the relief I feel that this man will be the president soon. I realize that&#8217;s what I feel above all else: <em>relief</em>.

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to Tuesday.</p>
