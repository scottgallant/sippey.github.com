<blockquote>
So consider this for just a second:&nbsp; the tool that they installed was not "strong enough" to handle the total load (traffic, roadbed, wind), yet this cracked Eyebar has been hanging up there for long enough to get nice and rusty, with this big crack that wiggles back and forth as the wind blows, as the traffic crosses the bridge and as the bridge expands and contracts as the bridge heats and cools.&nbsp; Don't you feel better now as you drive across the bridge (maybe one day soon)?</blockquote>
