<p>Jason Kottke turns his <a href="http://kottke.org/09/10/vc-funding-for-20x200#">20x200 congratulatory blog post</a> into a comment on the new FTC blogging disclosure policies.</p>

<blockquote>I may have unwittingly posed for photos next to 20x200 artwork hanging in my residence or in the residences of others, giving the impression that I am endorsing said artwork. Apologies.</blockquote>
