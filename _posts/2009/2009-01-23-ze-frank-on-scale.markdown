<p>If you're not reading Ze's blog <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/explicit/">the explicit</a>, you should be.  In today's post, <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/explicit/2009/01/notes_on_scale.html">Notes on Scale</a>, he remembers visiting a newspaper printing press as a child....</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a huge metal drum that spun so fast that the just-inked newspaper pages were a blur of streaked grey. I could feel that drum. The floor shook. The noise was enormous. I imagined that if that drum became unhinged it would tear a neat-violent path through the whole city. It was awesome, in the old sense of the word. But then I looked down at my watch. And I saw that tiny little second hand.</p>

  <p>Tick.</p>

  <p>The fact that those two moments could coexist was overwhelming. Almost nauseating. And I am drawn to this feeling in the same way that I canâ€™t help biting a sore lip.</p>
