<p>Khoi Vinh on <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2009/02/06/marketing-in-a-minute">his experience</a> trying to learn just what <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/ubiquity/">Ubiquity</a> for Firefox actually does...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Granted, the amount of time I’ve spent absorbing information about Ubiquity, distributed across a few Web browsing, Twitter and RSS sessions, probably totals less than five minutes. That’s not a lot of time in which to make a pitch… except that it’s all that many products get. I happened to know Aza and so I was predisposed to an interest in his work. But in any other instance in which I would have no personal connection with the people behind a product I doubt I would’ve gotten even as far as I did.</p>

<p>Fantastic reminder that when you're marketing a product online, you need to <strong>get to the point as quickly as possible.</strong></p>
