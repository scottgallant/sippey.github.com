<p>Bob Lefsetz does a <a href="http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/09/18/sales-week-ending-91309/">rundown</a> of the top selling records.  Coming in at number 48, Darius Rucker&#39;s &quot;Learn to Live.&quot;

</p><blockquote>A Hootie record.&#0160; Serviceable songs delivered in a heartfelt manner.&#0160; This still works in country, but not in pop.&#0160; In pop you’ve got to dress up like an alien, use computers and have beats that would level a cyclops.&#0160; But it’s the country artists who have careers, who people want to see on the road.&#0160; And if you still think country is twang, you haven’t listened in eons.</blockquote>
