<p>A quick followup on February's post re. the <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2009/02/peter-arnell-on-tropicana.html">Tropicana repackaging debacle</a>.  A few weeks ago my eight year old daughter and I were in the local grocery store and when she passed the o.j. section there were some cartons of Tropicana with the new packaging -- the ones that I thought had been recalled...the ones with the screwtop that looks and feels like an orange.</p>

<p>"Oh my God, Dad!" she shouted.  "Check this out!  The top!  Of this orange juice!  It's like an orange!  That's so cool!"</p>

<p>I just wanted to squeeze her tight.</p>
