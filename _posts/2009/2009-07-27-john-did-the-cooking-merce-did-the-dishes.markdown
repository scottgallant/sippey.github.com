<p>A 1981 interview with Merce Cunningham and John Cage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZNGpjXZovgk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZNGpjXZovgk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a snippet from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/arts/dance/28cunningham.html?_r=1&amp;hp">NYTimes story</a> about Cunningham's death yesterday at the age of 90.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For many years only a few people realized that the Cage-Cunningham relationship was sexual. Although their offstage partnership became an open secret, the subject was not open until 1989, when Cage, answering an unexpected public question about it, surprised everyone by replying, 'I do the cooking, and Merce does the dishes.' </p>
