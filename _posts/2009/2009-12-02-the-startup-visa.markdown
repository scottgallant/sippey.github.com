<p>Great op-ed from Paul Kedrosky and Brad Feld in today's WSJ <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704402404574525772299940870.html">proposing a startup visa</a>.  The challenge with getting something like this passed is having congresscritters understand this key point:  "Would it work every time? Of course not. It would fail more often than not. Start-ups often fail."</p>
