<blockquote>There are few things that feel&#0160; better than crushing a 90 mph fastball or throwing a runner out at the plate from the outfield , but the majority of things I miss the most didn&#39;t happen between the lines.</blockquote>

<p>My friend (and colleague at Six Apart) David Tokheim <a href="http://www.autograph-cards.com/s1_David_Tokheim.asp">played outfield in the Phillies organization</a> in the early &#39;90s, and has a great post up today about all the things / people that are outside of the game proper that he misses.  Speaking of which, I could use some &quot;Clubbies.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Clubbies are there to make your experience comfortable with food, supplies, hook-ups and anything you could possible need. I&#39;ll never forget Pauly or Harry from Clearwater in their Philly accent saying 100 times a day, &#39;you good...you good?&#39;&quot;</p>
