<p>Worth reading in full, things magazine on <a href="http://www.thingsmagazine.net/2009/08/power-and-speed.htm">speed and futurism</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Our fetishism of speed is increasingly detached from the physical realm - we crave the speed of download delivery, instant communication, mobile blogging, latency-free servers, intercontinental video calling, swift screen rotation, and instant messaging. The physical manifestations of speed still exist, of course, but are being slowly stigmatised.</blockquote>
