<p>Lehman Brothers had one hell of an art collection.  It&#39;s <a href="http://www.freemansauction.com/asp/searchresults.asp?t=1058674&amp;shopper=&amp;">up for auction at Freeman&#39;s</a> in Philadelphia.  You know you&#39;ve always wanted an Ed Ruscha tainted with the stench of economic collapse...and now it can be yours.</p>
