<p>I've posted about <a href="http://jeremydenk.net/blog/">Jeremy Denk</a> and his blog <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/03/on-bacon-chopin.html">before</a>, but just to reiterate -- you really should be reading this.  His latest -- <a href="http://jeremydenk.net/blog/2009/01/25/elegy-for-toothpaste/">Elegy for Toothpaste</a> -- is great reading, all the way through.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some morning soon I fully expect to be stopped by a TSA official, who will say:  "Mr. Denk, President Obama has alerted us that you are far too much of a pain in the a** to fly today."  And I will abjectly consent.  "Go home," they will say, "write a poem, eat a bagel, have a massage, do a crossword puzzle, fall in love, and then, only then, come back."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go read the whole thing.  It's eventually about toothpaste.</p>
