<p>The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze-t.html?_r=1&amp;src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes">covers the Where the Wild Things Are</a> in this Sunday&#39;s Magazine.  Overall the piece feels like Jonze&#39;s publicity machine cranking up the &quot;they gave us $80 million to make the movie but those studio types are boring corporate suits and it won&#39;t be our fault when it tanks at the box office&quot; story line.</p>

<p>And though I&#39;d love to be proven wrong, it sounds like the movie is gonna tank.*</p>

<blockquote>Most kids’ movies are brightly, mouthwateringly colorful; Jonze favored a mushy-vegetable palate of greens and browns. Most kids’ movies have a clearly defined plot and an unambiguous moral lesson; Jonze’s film has about as much plot as an episode of “Jackass.” Most kids’ movies crackle with one-liners; in “Where the Wild Things Are,” the characters talk over one another and spend a lot of time stumbling over their own words as they try to articulate their feelings. </blockquote>

<p>Jonze puts it this way...</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It&#39;s like the studio was expecting a boy, and I gave birth to a girl.  And now they&#39;re learning to love and accept their daughter.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>You know the next chapter of the saga will be the piece in November about how <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> bombed because the studio just didn&#39;t spend enough to market the daughter they thought would be a son; with the subplot being that the blogger / Twitter buzz that they were counting on just couldn&#39;t push it to a $100 mm opening weekend...never mind the fact that the thing was just too damned sad for anyone under the age of about 35.</p>

<p><small>* For point of reference, <em>G.I. Joe</em> has done $265 million in worldwide box office.</small></p>
