<p>I hate that this seems to be a recurring pattern in the &quot;media produced for love&quot; category.  Edward Champion puts his <a href="http://www.edrants.com/bat-segundo-hiatus/">Bat Segundo show on hiatus</a> after what sounds like an incredibly lousy interview with an author.</p>

<blockquote>I’ve always maintained that if what I do isn’t fun, then I have no interest in doing it.  And right now, The Bat Segundo Show, which <i>should</i> be fun, isn’t.</blockquote>
