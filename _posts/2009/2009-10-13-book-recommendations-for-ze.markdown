<p>Ze Frank <a href="http://twitter.com/zefrank/status/4843748732">asked</a> his followers on Twitter if they had "any recommendations for a great book?" and got flooded with replies.  He compiled a list ("about a third of the titles that came back") and <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/zesblog/archives/2009/10/a_short_list_of.html">put it on his blog</a>.  They're not <em>all</em> great, of course, but it's an interesting list and says something about Ze's fans...</p>
