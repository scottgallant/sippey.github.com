<p>So the head of AT&amp;T's wireless unit <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/12/09/att-to-new-york-and-san-francisco-were-working-on-it/">made news today</a> for having the gall to admit that their networks in San Francisco and New York "are performing at levels below our standards."  <em>(No, really?)</em></p>

<p>But T's corp comm folks didn't see that as the news angle. As posted in an update to the WSJ piece linked above, their spokesman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ralph de la Vega made significant news today in saying that, based on independent drive testing, we have 98.68 percent nationwide voice retainability, which means that the difference between AT&amp;T and the industry leader is less than 2/10 of a percentage point on this important metric. That translates to a difference of less than 2 calls out of a thousand.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cue the map.</p>
