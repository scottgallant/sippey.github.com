<p>Sasha Frere-Jones <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2009/09/set-list-sunn-o.html">on Sunn O)))</a>.  Warning:  EXCESSIVE SIMILE ALERT, but they&#39;re all so good.</p>

<blockquote>The median sound for Sunn O))) is a low chord, pitched below standard tuning, that blows through the crowd like a humid wind and stays in your body like that liquid they make you drink before you go through the <small>CAT</small>-scan machine. Standing in front of the stage on Tuesday night felt like a teen-age dare. How long could I stand to have my organs palpated? How could I tear myself away? Would the volume loosen up kinked muscles? Sterilize me?  ... After the show was over, my head felt like a bag of blueberry muffins that had been left under a bench for three days. I walked down Vanderbilt Avenue towards my house, sweaty and bereft of the ability to echolocate.

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been able to echolocate, and I haven&#39;t had the pleasure (?) of seeing Sunn O))).  But still, I get what he means.</p>
