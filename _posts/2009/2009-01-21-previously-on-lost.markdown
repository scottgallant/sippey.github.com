<p>OK, so the Lost chatter began today (what I meant with my last post was that tomorrow will be all about the Lost chatter; today would just be the quiet before the storm).  Via <a href="http://hello.typepad.com/">David</a>, this <a href="http://throwingthings.blogspot.com/2009_01_18_archive.html#8633932775461248659">mock interview with the Oceanic Six</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, we lived on the beach, mostly, except for the time we lived in the cave with the skeletons and the time we lived in the secret underground bunker with the lending library and the time we lived in the village built by the scientists that the people who donâ€™t age gassed to death with the help of their leader, my third nemesis, the nebbishy con man with spine cancer, which we took over when the freighter people came to kill everybody. </p>
