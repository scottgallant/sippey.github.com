<p>For no particular reason, here are <a href="http://sippey.com/2004/blog-snaps/">full-length screencaps</a> of ten "randomly selected" weblogs.  (If you care, all were through IE 6 on XP, with a browser window 850px wide.)  </p>

<p>And for whatever reason, I get a kick out of comparing lengths.</p>
