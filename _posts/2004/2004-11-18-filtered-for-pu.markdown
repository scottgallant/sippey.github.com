<p>Kudos to Matt Haughey for (finally!) implementing a nominal charge for <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/newuser.mefi">new MetaFilter memberships</a>....</p><blockquote><p>Due to the bursting size of the community, its use of resources, and
the cost of running the servers, all new users have a one-time $5
charge, to help defray these costs. Keep in mind this is a donation
towards the server, and not a purchase. If you sign up an account to
pimp your product, act like an ass, or generally just do things that
break the <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/guidelines.mefi">guidelines</a> you will be booted and there will be no refunded donations.</p></blockquote><p>I'm sure the <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/1238">irony-challenged</a> are happy that Haughey didn't implement all the ideas in my <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/2001/10/26.html">MetaFilter Proposal</a> from October 2001.</p>
