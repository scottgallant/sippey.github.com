<table border="0"><tr><td valign="top" align="left">The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> folks are just knocking the cover off the ball lately.  Their newest invention:  the <a href="http://flickr.com/fun/zeitgeist/">daily zeitgeist</a>.  Seen here on the right (but most likely not available via RSS, so if you're reading this in your aggregator be sure to clickthrough to see the full effect), it's a badge that displays an animated tile of community photos, your photos, your contacts' photos or yours and your contacts' photos.  The one at the right are photos from my contacts.</td><td valign="top" align="left"><script type="text/javascript">var zg_person_scope = 1;var zg_scope_nsid = '32373689668@N01';</script><script src="http://www.flickr.com/fun/zeitgeist/badge.js.gne" type="text/javascript"></script></td></tr></table>
