<p>A quick thing to note about Apple's preview of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Tiger</a>:  they're putting the RSS reader in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/safari.html">Safari</a> instead of Mail.app.  It's decisions like these by the major players (Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, Google, etc.) that will define the consumer mental model for feed consumption: does RSS augment/improve/replace the messaging experience?  Or does RSS augment/improve/replace the browsing experience?</p>
