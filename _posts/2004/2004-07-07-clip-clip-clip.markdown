<p>As a quick reminder, a good definition of <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci554703,00.html">walled garden</a> from whatis.techtarget.com.  <blockquote>On the Internet, a walled garden is an environment that controls the user's access to Web content and services. In effect, the walled garden directs the user's navigation within particular areas, to allow access to a selection of material, or prevent access to other material. ... Although the walled garden does not actually prevent users from navigating outside the walls, it makes it more difficult than staying within the environment.</blockquote>Don't be fooled, people.  It's all about the interop.</p>
