<p>Two signs that Amazon has a very diverse set of talent:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/13609381/104-5038919-4670339">Amazon Theater</a> (&quot;a series of five original short films available exclusively at Amazon.com as a free gift to our customers&quot;) and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_6/104-5038919-4670339?%5Fencoding=UTF8&node=13584001&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">Amazon Simple Queue Service</a> (&quot;a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for buffering messages between distributed application components&quot;).&nbsp; There's a joke in there somewhere about queuing up for the theater, but I'll leave that exercise to the reader.</p>
