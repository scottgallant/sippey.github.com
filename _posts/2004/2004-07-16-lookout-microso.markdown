<p>This actually did surprise me -- <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=194">Microsoft bought Lookout</a>, the search plugin that <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/03/lookout_softwar.html" title="post of mine from back in March">made Outlook usable</a> for email addicts.  I thought Microsoft would insist on doing this themselves....</p>
