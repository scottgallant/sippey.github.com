<p>Can't tell you how happy it makes me to learn of <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/">Wonkette</a>. Where the hell have I been these last few weeks? <a href="http://www.theanticmuse.com/">Ana Marie Cox</a> &amp; Washington insider politics gossipy analysis in an easily digestible format? TriFECTA, ladies and gentelmen. </p>

<p>(Quick moment of idolization: Ana edited the <a href="http://www.suck.com/fish/contributors/sippey/bio.html">few pieces</a> I wrote for <a href="http://www.suck.com/">Suck</a>. She made them muuuuuuuuch better than they were when they were originally submitted, and used every opportunity to push me to be a better writer. The pieces turned out great. Me and writing? Not so much.)</p>
