<p>Chris Anderson's piece <a title="Wired 12.10: The Long Tail" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html?pg=2&topic=tail&topic_set=">The Long Tail</a>, already linked to shreds, brought a smile to my face with a quote from <a href="http://www.ecastinc.com/">Ecast's</a> Robbie Vann-Adibe.  Robbie and I worked together at Viant, and I was on the Ecast team when Viant put together Ecast's original business plan, operating model and working prototype of their digital jukebox...</p>

<blockquote>Meet Robbie Vann-Adibe, the CEO of Ecast, a digital jukebox company whose barroom players offer more than 150,000 tracks - and some surprising usage statistics. He hints at them with a question that visitors invariably get wrong: "What percentage of the top 10,000 titles in any online media store (Netflix, iTunes, Amazon, or any other) will rent or sell at least once a month?" ... Most people guess 20 percent, and for good reason: We've been trained to think that way. ... But the right answer, says Vann-Adib√©, is 99 percent. There is demand for nearly every one of those top 10,000 tracks. He sees it in his own jukebox statistics; each month, thousands of people put in their dollars for songs that no traditional jukebox anywhere has ever carried.</blockquote>

<p>I can't tell you how happy that makes me.  Captured in there is the whole point of Ecast:  thousands of tracks, delivered transparently on demand, giving barflys access to  nearly whatever they'd want to hear at any time.  And the jukebox is the <em>perfect</em> place for a long tailed catalog -- at one point we had modeled (inebriated) people paying slightly <em>more</em> for tracks that they typically wouldn't find in a corner bar.</p>

<p>And layered on top of the "any song, anywhere" benefit for users is the data component.  Back in 1999/2000 when Ecast was blazing contractual trails with the major labels <em>("You're going to distribute digital versions of our catalogs to bars?")</em>, the folks on the other side of the table didn't quite get the value of the data Ecast would be collecting.  I have to believe that's changed:  Ecast is sitting on geographically tagged social purchase data.  As the hit business both concentrates and dissipates, being able to predict the lifetime value of a recording means more rational investments in artist development.  It may not be as richly detailed as the data from Soundscan or the iTunes Music Store, but if I were in A&R or artist marketing at a major label, I'd sure as hell want to layer jukebox stats into my forecasting models.  Music spreads socially, after all...and what's more social than feeding a fiver into the jukebox? </p>
