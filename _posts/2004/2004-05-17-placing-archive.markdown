<p><a href="http://interconnected.org">matt webb</a> pointed out to me that the wayback's archive of placing.com <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/05/placing.html">might not be so safe</a>, given what the new owners of 99secrets.com <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/99secrets.com/*">have done</a> with their robot excluder.  so unless my pal objects, placing has another home at <a href="http://www.carlsteadman.com/placing/">carlsteadman.com/placing</a>.</p>
