<p>So <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/08/04/HNaolmailblocks_1.html" title="infoworld story">AOL picked up Mailblocks</a>.  All the attention is focused on the Mailblocks challenge / response filtering methodology, which reportedly AOL will integrate into its existing mail services.  News.com even described Mailblocks as an "antispam software company" in <a href="http://news.com.com/AOL+snaps+up+antispam+company/2100-1032_3-5296425.html">its story</a>, instead of an email inbox provider (web, POP, IMAP) with great filtering tools.  But I'm more interested in what they're going to do with Mailblocks' web app, which while less whiz-bangy than Oddpost's is faster and more usable...though still not on Firefox.</p>

<p>Terms weren't disclosed.  Any guesses?  Oddpost: $30mm.  Mailblocks:  $____mm?</p>
