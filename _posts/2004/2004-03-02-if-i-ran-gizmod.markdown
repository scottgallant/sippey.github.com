<p>So Nick Denton's likely looking for someone to blog for <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo</a>.  If it were my pub, here's what I'd do.</p>

<ul><li>Shift the focus from the gadget to the user.  Forget speeds/feeds; think usage and emotion.</li>
<li>Scrap the single writer thing.  There's too much to cover.  Instead, hire <i>(<b>update:</b> or syndicate -- see comments)</i> 6-10 different ones.  Enable competing viewpoints on products.</li>
<li>Whatever you do -- don't assign those writers by product categories -- assign by lifestyle.  One covers teens.  Another covers campus tech.  Another covers urban hipsters.  Another for soccer dads/moms.  Another for middle manager types.  Another for executive chic.</li>
<li>Shifting to user / lifestyles will open up channel sponsorship opportunities -- wrap the teen market in XBox branding.  Wrap the college campus market in Apple branding.  Wrap the exec/chic market in Prada or something.</li>
<li>Distribute the content creation.  Use trackback / commenting / whatever to enable people to tell their own stories -- the street finds its own uses for things, so let the street tell you what it's doing with the tech that's in the stores now.</li></ul>

<p>Etc., etc.  The possibilities are endless.  <i>(<b>Update #2:</b>  what if one of those possibilities was Gizmodo as a <i>service</i> instead of a publication?  See comments.)</i></p>
