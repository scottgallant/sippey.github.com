<p>I know this will sound like an ad, but...  If you use Outlook, you need <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/">Lookout</a>, a plugin for Outlook that indexes your mail store (whether it's local or stored on an Exchange or IMAP server), attachments, your contact list, your calendar <i>and even your filesystem</i> and offers lightning-fast full-text search.  If you're still filing email into a zillion different folders, you need to get on with your life, install Lookout, and get your head around a three-folder lifestyle:  inbox, trash and "keepers."</p>

<p>Oh, and in case you're frustrated by the anemic "<a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/about.html">about us</a>" page, know that Lookout is a product of Eric Hahn and the <a href="http://www.ingroup.com/">Inventures Group</a>.  Hahn has deep, deep roots in email -- he was VP of Engineering at cc:mail, and went on to found Collabra, which became the core of Netscape's collaboration products.</p>
