<p>Dear Lazyweb,</p>

<p>Would someone please build FrooglePEG?  Just a little app that hits <a href="http://froogle.google.com/">froogle.google.com</a>, selects from the front page list of "items recently found with Froogle" pulls one of the images returned, and displays them in a never-ending stream?  Bonus points for making the speed at which images update configurable by the user.</p>

<p>Why?  Why not!  Who <i>wouldn't</i> want a real-time glimpse into the <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=power+wheels+barbie&sampleq=1">soul of ecommerce</a>?</p>

<p>Best,<br />
Michael</p>
