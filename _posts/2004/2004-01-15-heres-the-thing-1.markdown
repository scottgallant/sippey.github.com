<p>Here's the thing about this whole whiz-bang Internet.  All of it -- the remarkable web applications, the fantastic presence-facilitating servers, the IP telephony devices, the XML-RPC-enabled Perl scripts -- requires actual <em>connectivity</em>.  You know -- lines that sync, routers that route.  I find it very disconcerting that my personal technology stack relies on SBC at its base.</p>

<p>Damn you, Gilder, where's my fiber?</p>
