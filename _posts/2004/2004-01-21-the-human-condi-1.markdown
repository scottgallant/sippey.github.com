<p>Great <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/77e796ae3c7d073d47924eadccaa763a">microthread</a> happening at delicious, commenting on commenting on URLs.  My take: all technologies eventually (d)evolve into a messaging system, or as <a href="http://del.icio.us/mwiik">mwik</a> puts it, "the deliciousbloggingcommunitystreet finds its own uses for things."</p>
