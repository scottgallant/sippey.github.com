<p>Oh, man things are getting interesting in the Google v. Yahoo v. Microsoft battle.&nbsp; Gotta believe that Yahoo didn't <a href="http://news.com.com/Yahoo+buys+e-mail+search+company/2100-1025_3-5421831.html">pick up Stata Labs</a> for their Windows spam assassin client, but rather for the search tech that's inside Bloomba.&nbsp; It's not hard to imagine them building a rich client for email and feed reading that complements the online experience that I'm sure they're building with what they picked up from Oddpost.</p>

<p>The other interesting thing about this is that the Outlook-alternative market is once again wide open.&nbsp; It's now down to Eudora and Thunderbird, neither of which have decent email search tools, nor offer any significant &quot;intertwinglyness&quot; that modern communication clients so desperately need.</p>
