<p>I keep <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/01/very_rich_clien.html">harping</a> on this, but Office is becoming a very interesting rich client.  They have a ways to go to make services like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/associates/research-pane/download_rp.html/103-7121306-5278229">Amazon Research Pane</a> easy to install and use, but they're sitting on a very interesting opportunity to put more content in context.  (I'd love to see something like <a href="http://www.blinkx.com/overview_us.php">Blinkx</a> migrated into the pane...) <a href="http://www.remem.org/">Rememberance agent</a>, here we come!</p>
