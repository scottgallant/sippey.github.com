<p>Some interesting news from the OSAF -- they're hiring a <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/employment.htm">Program Manager</a>. Which means that Chandler must be far enough along in its development to actually need someone to translate, prioritize moderate and mediate end user requirements into a usable product. It'll be interesting to see who they land for this gig; I can't imagine a more important role in getting an actual product to market...</p>
