<p>Congrats to Ev <a title="evhead: Next?" href="http://www.evhead.com/2004/10/next.asp">on leaving Google.</a>  I owe him a debt of gratitude for inviting me to join Pyra's advisory board back when I thought <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/2000/05/01.html">Pyra was the killer app</a>.  Boy was I wrong....if he and Meg had listened to me, they'd probably have ended up up on the trash heap of enterprise software ASPs.  Thankfully, they were smarter than that, and helped create, shape and seed a new market and a new medium.</p>

<p>And hey!  Now we can have lunch and not worry about talking business.</p>
