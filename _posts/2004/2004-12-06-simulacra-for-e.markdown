<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/realestate/05nati.html?8dpc">Fascinating piece in the NYTimes</a> about people building <em>new</em> homes that are designed to look like they've been converted from industrial uses.</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>Mr. Binkley predicts that factory chic will become more popular, partly for nostalgic reasons: these designs will remind Baby Boomers of architecture they loved - though not necessarily lived in - from a time gone by.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I'm imagining an entire neighborhood of these.&nbsp; The faux-converted firehouse next to the faux-converted cannery next to the faux-converted warehouse next to the faux-converted barn.&nbsp; All with exposed beams, exposed brick walls and exposed duct work.&nbsp; All containing piles of newly purchased, artfully stacked coffee table books filled with images of actual firehouses, canneries, warehouses and barns that have been converted to residential use.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp; a kind reader sends a link to this glorious MetropolisMag.com piece, &quot;<a href="http://www.metropolismag.com/cda/story.php?artid=70">I am the Uncool Hunter</a>,&quot; complete with photos of a Frederick, Colorado development filled with faux-conversions.</p>
