<p>Aside from the acoustic Bowie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006JMLI4/statingtheobvioua/">covers</a> sung in Portugese, the best thing about Wes Anderson's <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0362270/">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a></em> has got to be the set.&nbsp; The two scenes that make the rounds of the ship -- the tour and then the argument -- left me speechless.&nbsp; In each of his films Anderson gets more adventurous with the fourth wall; his characters aren't talking directly to the audience, but the set, the Bowie covers and the highly stylized animated fish are each reminders that You're Watching A Movie.</p>
