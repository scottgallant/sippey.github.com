<p>Dear Mercury News / Realcities,</p>

<p>Why do you insist on telling me that "my email address is not in your records" when I subscribe to receive (and regularly open!) three of your email subscription products?  All I want to do is click between <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000676.php">this story</a> and <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/8743710.htm?1c">this story</a> without going through yet another poorly designed "log in or register" experience.</p>

<p>In other words, you should invest in a single sign-on system -- the excuse that "our email address database is managed separately," is not an acceptable excuse, <i>especially since you use email address as the user ID.</i></p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
Michael</p>
