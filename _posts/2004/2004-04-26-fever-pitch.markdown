<p>I wish I had been tracking and charting this along the way.  On December 12, 2003 a Google search for the phrase "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22google+ipo%22">google ipo</a>" pulled about 16,700 results.  Today, the same search yields about 52,500.  Note to meme watchers and keyword speculators:  imagine the wave of schadenfreude that'll be unleashed if the Google IPO <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22failed+google+ipo%22">doesn't perform</a> spectacularly...  </p>

<p>(Somewhat relatedly, someone should scrape and syndicate the <a href="http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist/weeks-apr04.html">weekly zeitgeist results</a> -- top 10 gainers, top 10 losers.  Top two declining queries for the week of 4/19?  "Lindows" and "easter bunny."  Wouldn't Michael Robertson look great in a <a href="http://www.buycostumes.com/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=5640&PCatID=&ccatid=">bunny suit</a>?)</p>
