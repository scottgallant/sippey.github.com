<p>I've been an avid <a href="http://www.feeddemon.com/">FeedDemon</a> user since Nick Bradbury announced the 1.0 beta.&nbsp; One of its best (and least-exploited) features is its user-customized newspaper styles:&nbsp; FeedDemon uses XLST to create different views of feed data, which end up rendered in an IE control.&nbsp; I've been building a newspaper style based on the &quot;Savvy&quot; style that uses a some simple JavaScript to show/hide news item details on click.&nbsp; Install this style, maximize the browser control (F11) and voila -- a streamlined 2-paned reader instead of (IMHO) an overdesigned 3-paned &quot;Outlook style&quot; reader.</p>

<p>Even though about five of you will know/care what the hell I'm talking about, I give this to you. </p>
