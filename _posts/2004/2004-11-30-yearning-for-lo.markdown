<p>Even with all the whiz bang of today's web(s), not a month goes by when I don't yearn for some of the early dotcoms.&nbsp; Who didn't love the at-my-beck-and-call convenience of Kozmo, and their on-demand Odwallas?&nbsp; Or the friendly delivery guys from Webvan and their green plastic buckets?&nbsp; Or even the feel-good <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/moblog/2004/11/trader_joes_dil.html">organic-or-free-range</a> dilemma vibe from WholePeople.com?</p>

<p>The one I'm missing presently is the erstwhile Garden.com.&nbsp; Remember them?&nbsp; Perfect integrators of content, commerce and community; the ones who smartly planted the &quot;add to wheelbarrow&quot; button in their interactive garden planner?&nbsp; Darlings of the IA crowd, Garden.com was one of those early &quot;trusted brands&quot; of ecommerce; the ones you knew you could go to 24/7 with your &quot;basil or bellflowers on the kitchen window sill&quot; question, and find an answer you could believe in.</p>

<p>The problem was, very few of us early adopter types were actually planting basil or bellflowers.&nbsp; We were just marveling at wonderful it was that if we ever needed to, we <em>could</em> buy basils or bellflowers (as well as soil and shoes and spades) from those nice, smart folks in Austin.&nbsp; You know the rest of the story, so feel free to insert your own awful pun about Garden.com dying on the vine.</p>

<p>But tonight, as I ponder that age old holiday question -- will this year be the year we do a live Christmas tree instead of a chopped one? -- I wish garden.com were here to help.&nbsp; Not that Google isn't helpful, mind you; there are plenty of sites advising me that it's probably not the best idea, since I can't be trusted to regularly change the oil in my car, much less water a plant on a daily basis and then replant it outside.&nbsp; But Garden would have told me all that with style, in a unique voice, wrapped in great nav, and with a perfectly matched set of cross-selling sidebars that, with luck, would have helped me cross a few folks off my Christmas shopping list.</p>
