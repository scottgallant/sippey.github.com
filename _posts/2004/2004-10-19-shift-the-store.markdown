<p>Billboard's reporting that <a title="Music Article | Reuters.com" href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=musicNews&storyID=6545086">Apple will ship iPods preloaded with U2's new record.</a></p>

<p>Step one of the "<a href="http://www.theobvious.com/new/2003.07.28.html">next gen iPod</a>" strategy that I mused about in July of last year.  Not that anyone with half a brain couldn't have generated that strategy on their own.  (And, after all, it's all about execution.)</p>

<p>Anyway.  Good stuff.</p>
