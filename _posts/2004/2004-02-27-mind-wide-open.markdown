<p>If you haven't already, be sure to pick up a copy of Steven Johnson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743241657/statingtheobvioua/"><i>Mind Wide Open</i></a>.  I finished it a few weeks ago, and the core concepts have been resonating in my head ever since.  Also, Johnson did a <a href="http://freshair.npr.org/day_fa.jhtml?display=day&todayDate=02/26/2004">great interview</a> on Fresh Air which aired yesterday.</p>
