<p>Why I love the web, reason #425.  There's actually a blog called "<a href="http://www.etlguy.com/">ETLGuy.com</a>," covering ETL projects, processes and technology.  He's even got a clever tagline ("data integration, one bit at a time").</p>

<p>Obviously, if you don't know what ETL stands for, then this ain't for you.</p>
