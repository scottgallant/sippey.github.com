<p>Doc Searls <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/02/16#liveFromDemo">reports</a> that <a href="http://www.oddpost.com/">Oddpost</a> demoed something called "NewsDash," with the positioning that "Newsdash does for the Web what TiVo does for television."  Why do I get the feeling that a good half dozen companies will be pitching us <i>exactly</i> the same story in the next few months?  The Tivo story works for television because the device/service combo transformed the relationship between broadcaster and viewer.  I don't buy "Tivo for the web" positioning because the web doesn't need that kind of transformation -- the viewer/reader/clicker is already in a position of control, with a myriad of tools at their fingertips (bookmarks, Google, email, weblogs, aggregators) to find, sort and manage content.</p>
