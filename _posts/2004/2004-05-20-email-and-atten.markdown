<p>Esther Dyson's speaking at <a href="http://www.inboxevent.com/2004/">Inbox</a> (hey, I'm in <a href="http://www.inboxevent.com/2004/conference_byDay.asp?CS_ID=1179">good company</a>!).  Despite all the hoo ha about the supposed <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22death+of+email%22">death of email</a>, Esther posts today about the <a href="http://weblog.edventure.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/20/71527.html">future of email</a>...</p>

<blockquote>More fundeamentally, as the world becomes more real-time and connected, the virtual and increasingly the actual configuration of the system is changing. There's a rich, complex, shared data store in the cloud, and mail is simply the passing of notifications and alerts that tell you to pay attention to/download specific items in the cloud that are new or changed or that someone wants to share with you. this creates huge challenges in version control, updating and permission management. </blockquote>

<p>Outside the realm of person-to-person correspondence, email is about notification, information flow, and as Esther points out later in the post, <i>attention management</i>.  Esther's right on the money that clients will evolve to help individuals manage that flow, and make sure that they're paying attention to the right stuff.  But it's a two-way street -- the senders that get it right will win good will, incremental business and long term loyalty from their readers / users / customers.</p>
