<p>A 2003 resolution that paid off, at least in psychic terms:  backup more frequently.  In our x-platform house this is done through a shell script on the laptop that's launched from Cygwin, rsync-ssh'ing over to the iMac and dumping everything that's changed.  Even over 802.11b it only takes ten minutes to do an incremental rsync once or twice a week.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn't account for the servers.  And I absolutely do <i>not</i> post this in some sort of twisted, self-satisfied reaction to the fact that <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/">interconnected</a> is most likely gone, gone, gone.  That, friends, just makes me sad.</p>

<p>2004?  More offline in my online.  More on that to come.</p>
