<p>Just can't tell you how excited I am about <a href="https://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/11/rich_text_editi.html" title="TypePad gets WYSIWYG and spell check">this</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If there's anything that the current batch of web apps is teaching us, it's that the tiniest details of interaction ergonomics can have a <a title="my post on gmail and its big tivo-like archive button" href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/04/notes_on_gmail.html">great deal of influence</a> over how apps get used.&nbsp; That's not to say that WYSIWYG post editing and integrated spell checking are by any stretch of the imagination &quot;tiny details.&quot;&nbsp; But the team has paid a tremendous amount of attention to the fit and finish of the new post editing screen, and now I can only hope that our customers will continue their tradition of piping up with feedback and suggestions so that we can make it better.</p>
