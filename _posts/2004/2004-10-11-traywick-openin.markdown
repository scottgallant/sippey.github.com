<p>Late last year Traywick Gallery morphed into <a href="http://www.traywick.com/">Traywick Contemporary</a> when Trina moved her business from her gallery space on Gilman in Berkeley into our house, gracefully making the shift from &quot;retail&quot; to &quot;private&quot; dealer.&nbsp; We installed flat files, turned a massive closet into art storage, buffed up the home office...and now she's doing just what she did before -- representing her artists and connecting them with collectors -- in a different environment.&nbsp; </p>

<p>While she's been doing a few private events and artist talk type things at the house, it's not all wine and brie.&nbsp; Back in March she took over the basement space of <a href="http://www.crownpoint.com/">Crown Point Press</a> (formerly occupied by the dearly-departed Refusalon) for a month-long show of <a href="http://www.traywick.com/2004/03/susan_martin.html">Susan Martin's sculpture</a> (reviewed <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/20/DDGD35NC821.DTL">here</a> by Kenneth Baker).&nbsp; Starting this Thursday the 14th she'll be in the 49 Geary building in downtown San Francisco for five weeks with a show of <a href="http://traywick.com/2004/10/charles_labelle.html">Charles LaBelle's compound photographs</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you don't know LaBelle's work, you should.&nbsp; He takes thousands of photos while traveling, cuts 1 inch square pieces from contact sheets, and assembles them into large (think 3 by 6 foot) tapestries.&nbsp; They're absolutely stunning.&nbsp; If you're in San Francisco Thursday night, come by:&nbsp; 5-7 pm, 49 Geary, 5th Floor.&nbsp; The show runs from Wednesday - Saturday, 11-5 from October 14 through November 20.</p>
