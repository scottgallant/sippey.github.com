<p>Anil <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/03/19/outlook_as_a_pl">nails</a> what's happening with Outlook -- it's a platform, not a product.  And I don't think he's even using it in its fully glory, as a client for Exchange and (to a lesser extent) Sharepoint.  While everyone's been nattering on about the transformative power of social software, Microsoft's actually been <i>building</i> it, and pushing collaborative tools down into the apps where people live -- Outlook and the rest of the Office suite.</p>
