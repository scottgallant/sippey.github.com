<p>Bryan Boyer points out a smart Gmail UI doo-hickey. If you have invites available, and you're replying to someone who does not have a gmail.com address, you get an unobtrusive menu item that lets you invite that person to Gmail. And it's personalized with that person's first name. ("Invite Tekla to join Gmail.")</p>
