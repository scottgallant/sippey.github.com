<p>Picked up Ron Suskind's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743255453/statingtheobvioua/">The Price of Loyalty</a> over the weekend.  Can't put it down.  Best paragraph so far, from O'Neill's account of his first meeting with Bush in the oval office...</p>

<blockquote>The President seemed to nod in affirmation. O'Neill couldn't be sure.</blockquote>

<p>Frightening.</p>
