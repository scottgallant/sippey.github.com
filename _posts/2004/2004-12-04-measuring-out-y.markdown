<p>And then, when you're done, task-switch back to your time-sucking RSS reader or your overloaded inbox or your miles-long list of things that have to get done Real Soon Now or the entire existence you've built for yourself will come crashing down on your head like a load of bricks, and thank the good Lord above that you're not anywhere near this organized.&nbsp; You just wouldn't know what to do with the <em>time</em>...</p>
