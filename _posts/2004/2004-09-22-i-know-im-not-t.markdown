<p>All it takes is one goddamned story about Cat Stevens and I've got <a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Cat-Stevens/Moon-Shadow.html">Moon Shadow</a> stuck in my head.  Quick, someone bring me something cleansing and astringent -- like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002OERI0/statingtheobvioua/">new Green Day</a>, perhaps -- before this ear worm eats its way through my brain.</p>
