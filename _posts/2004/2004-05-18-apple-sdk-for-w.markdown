<p>Interesting news from Ars Technica:  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news/posts/1084819754.html">Apple opens up iTunes interface on Windows</a>.  I'd love to see all the little iTunes hacks start coming to Windows.  Support for Bluetooth remoting, "now playing" widgets like there are for WinAmp, etc.  What I'm hoping, though, is that this could enable some enterprising <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/">Slim</a> developer to enable Fairplay-protected AAC playback on the Squeezebox.</p>
