<p>When I wrote <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/new/2003.07.28.html">this piece</a> last July, I had visions of Apple pre-loading iPods with demographically targeted music selections.  But I <em>love</em> <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/news.php?id=555">this story</a>:  Duke University will be giving away iPods to incoming freshmen preloaded with Duke-related content and couple it with a Duke-specific version of the music store.  The folks at Apple are definitely getting creative, leveraging their existing ties to the educational market to push the iPod line.</p>
