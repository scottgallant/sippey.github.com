<p>A while back I posted about <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2003/11/where_are_the_y.html">declining television viewership</a> amongst males aged 18-34.  iMedia Connection is <a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/features/010804c.asp">reporting</a> that the latest "Simultaneous Media Usage Survey" from <a href="http://www.bigresearch.com/">BIGresearch</a> shows that "the missing demographic is migrating toward instant messaging and the Internet."</p>

<p>Amazing numbers:  since August of 2002, 18-24 y/o male television viewership decreased 8.8%.  24-34 y/o male television viewership decreased 12.2%.  They're spending more time online than they are watching TV -- 187 minutes v. 160 minutes, respectively.  And they're doing it in primetime:  more than 40% reported online activity between the hours of 7:30 and 11:00 pm.  Joe Pilotta, the VP from BIGresearch, hits it on the head.</p>

<blockquote>"The Internet requires more involvement plus more of an action orientation, especiallywith gaming on computers," he explains.  "Also, TV programming has little to say to this age group."</blockquote>
