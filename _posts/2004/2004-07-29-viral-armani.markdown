<p>Speaking of <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/07/cost_per_influe.html">cost per influence</a>, there's an interesting piece in this month's <a href="http://www.style.com/w/">W</a> (the one with <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0424060/">Scarlett Johansson</a> on the cover) about the efforts of Giorgio Armani to dress the non-Hollywood A-listers in an attempt to influence the purchase behavior of their social circles.<blockquote>The designer, one of the first to get his suits on the silver screen and to set up an L.A. office for celebrity dressing, has come up with a way to reach women who don't flip through fashion magazines every month and who don't idolize Nicole Kidman or Beyonce.  The strategy?  H dresses a network of smart, stylish, well-bred women who are well known in their own countries and lets them get on with their lives. ... <br /><br />The ladies receive a new capsule wardrobe each season, in addition to travel expenses and, in some cases, a retainer -- depending on the individual.  The big payoff for the house, of course, comes when their photos appear in <em>Hello!</em>, <em>Point de Vue</em>, <em>El Pais</em> or <em>Vanity Fair</em>.  But often there are more subtle returns:  a photograph in a small local paper, or extra attention at a social event.   "You can't imagine how many people walk up to me at parties and ask who designed my tuxedo jacket," says [Celine] Charloux, a French polo player and one of Armani's newest diplomats.</blockquote>Nice work if you can get it.</p>
