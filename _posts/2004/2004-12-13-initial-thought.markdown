<p>A few from-the-hip reactions to Microsoft's new desktop search client...&nbsp; First, the good:</p>

<ul><li>It's fast.&nbsp; I don't have the largest library of docs and email, but I also don't have the fastest processor / hard drive, and I was done indexing in about fifteen minutes.&nbsp; And results are returned very quickly as well.</li>

<li>The search results UI is rich.&nbsp; This is my primary complaint with the Google desktop search -- returning local results in a web page limits options for sorting, filtering, etc.&nbsp; Microsoft's integrates into Explorer, and lets you filter by documents, messages, contacts, etc., and then sort by date, author, etc.</li>

<li>Deskbar incremental search.&nbsp; It exists, it's responsive, returns likely results, and stores your search history.</li></ul>

<p>But in my humble opinion, the UI needs work...</p>

<ul><li>Generally they've limited the power-user's ability to customize the look and feel of the toolbars, the app, etc.</li>

<li>The Outlook toolbar doesn't let you customize its buttons -- you can't remove the butterfly -- and won't let you drag and drop the toolbar (like any other) to different areas of the app.</li>

<li>Similar complaint with the deskbar -- you can't remove the butterfly, and it doesn't behave terribly well when you have your taskbar set to auto-hide, or if you have your taskbar docked to anywhere else except the bottom of your screen.</li>

<li>The search result UI is rich, but could use some information design.&nbsp; The titles of the documents or subject lines of the emails are only distinguished by color, and not by font weight or size.&nbsp; </li>

<li>There are no options for configuring the search results UI.&nbsp; I'd love, for instance, to limit or eliminate the preview in order to show more results per screen.</li>

<li>Related to that, the chrome is out of control.&nbsp; More blue pixels, and more butterflies.&nbsp; I get the need for branding; but this just screams &quot;our branding is more important than your search results.&quot;&nbsp; Bleh.</li></ul>

<p>Unfortuntely, it's the UI things that are driving me to uninstall.&nbsp; I live in Windows about 12 hours a day, and have spent plenty of time customizing the way its UI looks, feels and works.&nbsp; I'm not ready for butterflies everywhere.&nbsp; It makes me wonder else they're planning on pushing the MSN brand into the Windows user experience...</p>
