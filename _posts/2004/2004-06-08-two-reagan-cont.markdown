<p>Great pair of op-ed pieces in today's Times that help put context around the Reagan legacy.  First, Paul Krugman <a href="http://nytimes.com/2004/06/08/opinion/08KRUG.html">debunks</a> the myth of Reagan as the patron saint of tax cuts:<blockquote>But Ronald Reagan does hold a special place in the annals of tax policy, and not just as the patron saint of tax cuts. To his credit, he was more pragmatic and responsible than that; he followed his huge 1981 tax cut with two large tax increases. In fact, no peacetime president has raised taxes so much on so many people. This is not a criticism: the tale of those increases tells you a lot about what was right with President Reagan's leadership, and what's wrong with the leadership of George W. Bush.</blockquote>From the other side, David Brooks <a href="http://nytimes.com/2004/06/08/opinion/08BROO.html">argues</a> that Reagan's trademark optimism was more than just a personality trait.<blockquote>Reagan described America as a driving force through history, leading to the empire of liberty. He seemed to regard freedom's triumph as a historical inevitability. He couldn't look at mainstream American culture as anything other than the delightful emanation of this venture. He could never feel alienated from middle American life, or see it succumbing to a spiritual catastrophe.</blockquote></p>
