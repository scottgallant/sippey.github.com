<p>Now here's an <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6656556/">interesting product placement matchup</a>:&nbsp; Aflac and Lemony Snicket.&nbsp; Not only will Aflac ads contain scenes from the &quot;Series of Unfortunate Events,&quot; (get it?) but movie will actually have a scene with the quacking duck...though he won't be squawking the brand name.&nbsp; Here's Laura Kane, Aflac's veep of corp comm:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>“We think it’s the first time an insurance company's done product placement,” Kane said. “We don't have an actual product; we're selling a promise. We think this takes product placement to a whole new level.”</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Indeed, IMDB has the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339291/">movie's entry</a> correctly listing Gilbert Gottfried as the voice of the Aflac duck.</p>
