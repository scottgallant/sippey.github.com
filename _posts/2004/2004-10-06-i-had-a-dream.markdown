<p>Being at this conference is a little bit like stepping back in time. Eight years ago, in one of the few pieces I wrote for Suck.com, <a title="Suck: Daily" href="http://www.suck.com/daily/1996/06/04/">I had a dream</a>...</p><blockquote><p>A dream of mythic proportions. A dream that began with the first kill file I ever wrote. A dream of declaring myself independent of this so-called &quot;online community.&quot; I want to become one of the Freemen of the Internet.</p></blockquote><p>With all the talk of personalized search results, custom-spliced RSS feeds and APIs that will give me programmatic access to <em>just</em> the right set of products, their prices and their reviews, the dream is just starting to come true.</p>
