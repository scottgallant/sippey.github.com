<p>Via Curt Gardner's <a href="http://www.perival.com/delillo/">fantastic site</a>, comes <a href="http://www.perival.com/delillo/ddarticles.html">news</a> of a new piece from Don DeLillo titled "Counterpoint: Three movies, a book and an old photograph" in the latest <a href="http://www.grandstreet.com/">Grand Street</a>.</p>

<p>(But my <em>God</em> don't bother with Grand Street's website.  Useless, useless flash with bouncing animated navigation and unreadable text.  The only saving grace is that the #1 bookstore in their list of retailers is my local <a href="http://www.blackoakbooks.com/">Black Oak Books</a>.  Off to the retailer we go for a single issue purchase, when they could have easily lured us into a subscription and a more profitable (direct) relationship.  But I digress...  New DeLillo!)</p>
