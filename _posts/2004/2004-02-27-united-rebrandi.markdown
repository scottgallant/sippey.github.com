<p>This just in from the Titanic deck chair arrangement committee:  United Airlines is <a href="http://www.unitedrhapsody.com/">rebranding</a>!</p>

<blockquote>In the next few weeks, we will be unveiling a new look.
You&rsquo;ll start seeing new advertisements, hearing our new tagline and maybe even seeing newly painted planes in the sky.</blockquote>

<p>I realize that for United these incremental marketing expenses are a drop in the bucket compared to things like, say, mechanics labor.  And fuel.  And aircraft rent.  And gate fees.  And there's probably some financial model somewhere within United that proves out the return on these expenses.  (At least, I would hope there is.)  Nevertheless, this all seems like putting lipstick on a pig...</p>
