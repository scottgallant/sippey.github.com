<p>At Web 2.0...  Bill Gross just introduced <a title="Snap" href="http://www.snap.com/index.php">Snap</a>, a new search site from Idealab.  I'll contribute to the blog pile on with a few quick notes...</p>

<p>1) Snap is a big contrarian bet against Google aesthetic.  Search results are presented in a very rich, reasonably heavy set of controls that enable the use to filter and sort results.  They're going to enable advertisers to create rich presentations for their products -- bucking the "text ad" trend that the goog pioneered.</p>

<p>2) Snap is a huge bet on increasing user sophistication.  The current version of the UI is, shall we say, <em>advanced</em>.  (If you like X1, you'll like Snap.)  Depending on what you're searching for, the system could return results in two panes -- one where they're trying to be reasonably smart about what you're looking for, the other for more "raw" results.  (Try it on a search for "<a href="http://www.snap.com/search.php?query=new%20car&family=1">new car</a>," for example.)  The type-ahead filtering is slick, but I don't see my Mom "getting it" initially.  </p>

<p>3) The transparency thing is intriguing...  They're making public all of their <a href="http://www.snap.com/stats_home.php">user stats</a>, including search volume, page views, number of advertisers, paid clicks, and <em>revenue</em>.  If it works, it could provide the incentive for ad buyers to buy on Snap.  If it doesn't work, it will provide a fantastic dashboard for journos and bloggers looking for a quick stat...  Battelle brought up an interesting point, that Idealab company Overture pioneered transparency in cost per click, and people hated <em>that</em> for the first year of its life...</p>

<p>4) Oh, and I almost forgot this one.  Isn't <a href="http://www.snap.com/">Snap</a> a very Web 1.0 name?  <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1997/06/24.html" title="stating the obvious piece from 1997 about the site formerly known as gunsmoke">Think back...way back</a>.</p>
