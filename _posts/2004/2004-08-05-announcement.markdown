<p>A quick announcement:  in another week or so I'll be joining <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> as VP, Product.  </p>

<p>I've been doing personal web publishing in various forms and methods for going on nine years now -- while doing daytime things like <a href="http://www.advent.com/">managing products</a>, <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/">going to school</a>, <a href="http://www.viant.com/">consulting</a>, <a href="http://www.quris.com/">building email progams</a> and advising <a href="http://www.pyra.com/">a</a> <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">few</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">startups</a>.  <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/">Stating the Obvious</a> and <a href="http://www.sippey.com/">sippey.com</a> have enabled me to find a voice, float ideas, build new friendships and experiment with the tools that empower individuals and teams to share and spread ideas and information.</p>

<p>It's not every day that you're given the opportunity to turn your after work passion into your full time job.  I couldn't be more excited to join Mena, Ben, Barak, Anil, Andrew, Ezra, Paul, Mie and the rest of the crew at Six Apart.</p>

<p>(Yee haw!)</p>
