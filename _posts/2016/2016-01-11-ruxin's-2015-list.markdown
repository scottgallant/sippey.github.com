At long last (a whole *eleven* days into the new year), Marc Ruxin’s list of [the best music of 2015](https://medium.com/@ruxputin/the-bestest-tunage-2015-54ab3af84981#.csxwgeh2e). 

> there is a select strain of electronic music that I adore, but this year’s best music is more a tribute to the past than a nod to the future.

His annual list is always good; I can’t wait to dive into some of these; and love that the first record on the list (Tobias Jesso Jr. — Goon) is one I haven’t heard yet.
