<p>Chef <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Achatz">Grant Achatz</a> of <a href="http://www.alinea-restaurant.com/">Alinea</a> has been <a href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/a-chefs-toughest-challenge/">diagnosed</a> with <a href="http://www.skincancer.org/squamous/index.php">squamous cell carcinoma</a> of the mouth.<a title="A Chefs Toughest Challenge - Dinerâ€™s Journal - Dining &amp; Wine - New York Times Blog" href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/a-chefs-toughest-challenge/">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; His statement:</p><blockquote><p>
I wanted to personally report that I have been very recently diagnosed
with an advanced stage of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the mouth. I have
consulted several prominent physicians and will likely begin aggressive
treatment within the next few weeks. I remain, and will remain,
actively and optimistically engaged in operations at Alinea to the
largest extent possible. Alinea will continue to perform at the level
people have come to expect from us -- I insist on that. I have received
amazing support from friends, family, and everyone who has thus far
been told of the disease, and I look forward to a full, cancer-free,
recovery.</p></blockquote>
