<p>Robert Olen Butler's (now open) <a href="http://gawker.com/news/money-changes-everything/elizabeth-dewberry-left-robert-olen-butler-to-join-ted-turners-collection-284346.php">email re. his wife leaving him for Ted Turner</a> really could have used an editor.&nbsp; An editor that would have consigned the entire thing to the &quot;never to be spoken of again, much less sent&quot; folder.</p><blockquote><p>I was able to help her a great deal. She says I saved her life. But de
facto therapy as the initial foundation of a marriage eventually sucks
the life out of a relationship. And it is very common for a woman to be
drawn to men who remind them of their childhood abusers. Ted is such a
man, though fortunately, he is far from being abusive. From all that I
can tell, he is kind to her, loyal, considerate, and devoted to his
family, and perhaps, therefore, he can redeem some things for her.</p></blockquote><p>Wow wow wow.&nbsp; Train wreck in Tallahassee, details at 11.</p>
