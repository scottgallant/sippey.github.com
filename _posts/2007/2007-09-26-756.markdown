<p>There's no way Major League Baseball could say anything else but this about <a href="http://www2.vote756.com/marcecko/">Vote 756</a>.  <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AvolqPalJXD6BleUEStJALURvLYF?slug=ap-bonds-756ball&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">This</a> from Hall of Fame president Dale Petroskey:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This ball wouldn't be coming to Cooperstown if Marc hadn't bought it from the fan who caught it and then let the fans have their say," Petroskey told The Associated Press. "We're delighted to have the ball. It's a historic piece of baseball history."</p>
