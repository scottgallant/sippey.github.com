<p>Can't a glass wall just be a glass wall?&nbsp; Penelope Green trots out Sherry Turkle in her Times piece on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/weekinreview/04green.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1351918800&amp;en=832cba4352eea26e&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin">peekabo architecture</a>. </p>

What do we show and what do we hide? </p>

<p>“That mirrors what happens when we’re on the computer, on our networks in Facebook. We are no longer able to distinguish when we are together and nurtured and when we are alone and isolated. I can be in intimate contact with 300 people on e-mail, but when I look up from my computer I feel bereft. I haven’t heard a voice, touched a hand, for hours or days. I think people are no longer certain where the self resides.”</p></blockquote>
