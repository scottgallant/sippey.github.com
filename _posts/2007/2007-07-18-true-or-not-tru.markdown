<p><a href="http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/">Errol Morris is blogging</a> at nytimes.com on photography, and <a href="http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/pictures-are-supposed-to-be-worth-a-thousand-words/">kicks it off</a> with a post on the relationship between photos, their captions and &quot;truth.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>Truth or falsity “adheres” not to the photograph itself but to the
statements we make about a photograph. Depending on the statements, our
answers change. All alone — shorn of context, without captions — a
photograph is neither true nor false.</p></blockquote>
