<p>From <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2007/05/top_ten_wishes_.html">this very blog</a>, just one week ago:</p><blockquote><p>I wish this plane had a screen in the seatback in front of me showing
one of those neat real time maps.&nbsp; But instead of showing progress at
the state or nation-state level, it would show progress at street or
near-street level, so that instead of having that &quot;Wow, this flight is
taking forever&quot; feeling, you could have that &quot;Holy shit we're going
incredibly fast&quot; feeling.&nbsp; It almost goes without saying that this Holy
Shit Map(tm) should be toggle-able between map, satellite and hybrid
modes.</p></blockquote><p>From investor.jetblue.com, <span class="ccbnTtl"><a href="http://investor.jetblue.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=131045&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1011379&amp;highlight=">JetBlue Airways Announces Partnership With Google Maps to Provide Real-Time Flight Tracking Feature</a>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span class="ccbnTxt">JetBlue Airways Corporation (Nasdaq:JBLU) today
announces a partnership with Google Maps to provide customers with a
real-time flight tracking channel on its signature seatback televisions
to map the aircraft's route.</span></p></blockquote><p>Maybe I should blog more often.</p>
