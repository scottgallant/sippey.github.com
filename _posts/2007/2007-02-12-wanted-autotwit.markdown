<p>Really, I'm just Too Damned Busy to update <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> in real time with status updates about my life.&nbsp; My &quot;followers&quot; are thankful for this, because if I were to update them with the truth, boredom-induced tears would fall from their face, land on their cellphones and short out the circuitry.&nbsp; So to save my friends and their cellphones from death by boredom, I hereby beseech the LazyWeb to create the auto-Twitter generator to periodically post messages on my behalf about my &quot;alternate&quot; life.</p>

<ul><li>&quot;On my way to that conference in Rome; thank god for upgrade certificates, otherwise would have been stuck in business class.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;Lunch with Don downtown talking about the new book.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;Leisurely enjoying some well-brewed Blue Bottle coffee while crushing the Sunday crossword puzzle.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;Wii!&quot;</li>

<li>Etc.</li></ul>

<p>Extra points for integrating user-submitted Twitters along with a Digg-style voting system.&nbsp; Let the community build my alernate life!</p>

<p>(Of course, blogging about my lack of Twitter updates qualifies me for some kind of ridiculousness prize, so I'll shut up now and point you to my <a href="http://twitter.com/sippey/statuses/5469658">latest entry</a>.&nbsp; Because what else is all this multi-billion dollar infrastructure good for if not going oh-so-meta on the latest celebrity scandal?)</p>
