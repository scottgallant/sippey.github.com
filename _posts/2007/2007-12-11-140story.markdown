<p>I really like what Joshua Rothhaas (from <a href="http://kindofdelicious.blogspot.com/">kindofdelicious</a>) is doing at <a href="http://twitter.com/140story">twitter.com/140story</a>, where every tweet is a story written in 140 characters or less. He doesn't connect on every one, but he'd have a decent major-league batting average. Here are a few of my favorites:</p>

<blockquote><p>Avid mountain climber, venture capitalist and daredevil, he had but one fear in this world: love, because &quot;only a real man can be a lover.&quot;</p>

<p>Two design students fall madly in love and make terribly bold statements holding each other to be more perfect than the typeface Helvetica.<span class="entry-title entry-content"><br /></span></p>

<p>Nation wide protest lead to
state wide crackdowns lead to city wide arrest and to local activism
which gave way to powerful personal apathy.</p></blockquote>
