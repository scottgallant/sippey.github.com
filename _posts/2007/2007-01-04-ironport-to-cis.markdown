<p>Congrats to Scott Weiss and the whole crew at Ironport (<a href="http://www.ironport.com/company/ironport_pr_2007-01-04.html">read the announcement</a> -- bought by Cisco for $800mm in cash and stock).&nbsp; I had a chance to meet Scott back when email was my life, and from the beginning it was clear they were building a great product and a great company.&nbsp; Kudos!</p>
