<p>So I'm stuck on the BART platform with train delays, and while I could call home to let them know I'm running late, what I would really love is a mounted display in my house that I could send an SMS to. It would be useful for low impact but reasonably time sensitive messages like &quot;BART excitement, big delays&quot; or even just little notes to the kids throughout the day (&quot;Hi, munchkins!&quot;).</p>
