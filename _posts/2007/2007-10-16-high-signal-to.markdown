<p>Jason Kottke <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/10/the-rest-is-noise">interviews</a> Alex Ross, music critic for The New Yorker, author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rest-Noise-Listening-Twentieth-Century/dp/0374249393">The Rest is Noise</a></em>, and author of a <a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/">TypePad blog</a> by the same name.&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote><p>When you have a repertory that goes from Hildegard von Bingen's
medieval chant to Vivaldi's bustling Baroque concertos to Wagner's
five-hour music dramas to John Cage's chance-produced electronic noise
to Steve Reich's West African-influenced &quot;Drumming,&quot; you're not talking
about a single sound.</p></blockquote>
