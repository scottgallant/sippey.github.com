<p>We introduced the beta release of Movable Type 4 last night, as well as a new <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">movabletype.org</a>.&nbsp; However, we're seeing some delays in getting DNS propagated throughout the web.&nbsp; If you're having trouble reaching movabletype.org, here are links to the Beta 1 releases of Movable Type 4.&nbsp; Once DNS has fully propagated, I'll remove the links from this page and point everyone back to www.movabletype.org.</p>
