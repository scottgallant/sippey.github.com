<p>Recommended: Florian Balmer's <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">notepad2</a> (for Windows), &quot;a fast and light-weight Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting.&quot;&nbsp; Free, simple, well-designed and gets out of your way and lets you focus on what you're supposed to be doing, which is writing and editing gobs and gobs of Markdown.</p>
