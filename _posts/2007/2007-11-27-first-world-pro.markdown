<p>From Katherine Boehret's <a href="http://solution.allthingsd.com/20071128/a-pad-to-easily-power-up-your-phone/">review of the Wildpad</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The pad, from WildCharge Inc. in Scottsdale, Ariz. (<a rel="external" href="http://www.wildcharge.com/">www.wildcharge.com</a>),
eliminates the messy tangle of wires that many people struggle with
each time they want to charge their portable devices. But more to the
point, it turns charging a gadget into something that happens in the
background rather than an active task. And it spares you from that
nagging question: Did I remember to plug my phone or iPod or BlackBerry
in before going to sleep?</p></blockquote><p>Thank GOD charging my phone is now something that happens in the background. I can't tell you how much mental energy I've wasted over the years on that incredibly active task.</p>
