</p><blockquote cite="http://blogs.business2.com/business2blog/2007/01/2007_the_web_wi.html"><p>The reason Web widgets are important is because they are the most concrete manifestation of something else that is happening.&nbsp; The Web is splintering.</p></blockquote><p>
Splintering away from the portals, sure, and then reaggregating in places where individual expression happens - blogs, profile pages, etc.&nbsp; Widgets are another point in the trendline of cut-and-paste culture:&nbsp; mix and match content and functionality to fit my personality, my blog, my audience.</p>
