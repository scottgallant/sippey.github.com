<p>NBC's Jeff Gaspin on how <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/business/media/20nbc.html?ref=technology">shows that fans download from their new online service</a> will self-destruct:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The files would degrade after the seven-day period and be unwatchable. "Kind of like 'Mission: Impossible,' only I donâ€™t think there would be any explosion and smoke," Mr. Gaspin said.</p>
