<p>Dick Costolo, CEO of FeedBurner, has launched my new favorite blog, &quot;<a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/">Ask the Wizard</a>.&quot; I've known Dick for years, but when we get together we don't get into Deep Conversations about startup life and competitive strategy; instead we talk shop in the &quot;let's gossip and tell jokes and wonder just how this person manages to attend so many conferences&quot; kind of way.</p>

<p>So I'm thankful he's blogging his CEO / startup experiences, because now I'm learning about a whole other side of Dick.&nbsp; As in &quot;Holy cow, he really is that smart; I could have sworn he was just faking it.&quot; Unless, of course, he's hired a ghost writer and this is just draft work on his way to some unannounced book deal.</p>

<p>Recommended post:&nbsp; read all about <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/2007/02/strategic_advantage_part_ii.html">Quantum Hidden Barriers to Entry</a>. Not only his analysis spot on, but he uses the word &quot;quantum,&quot; which makes it <em>that much cooler.</em></p>
