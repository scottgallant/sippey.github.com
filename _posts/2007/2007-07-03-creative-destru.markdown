<p><strong>The blog is dead, long live the blog.</strong>&nbsp; I've been mucking about with a new-ish form at a new-ish URL, and it's time to flip the bit.&nbsp; The switch from <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/">/filtered</a> to <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/unfiltered/">/unfiltered</a> is an attempt to return to what I used to do at theobvious.com long long ago with &quot;filtered for purity&quot;: offer reasonably context-free nuggets of linky goodness. </p>


<p>The <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/">old stuff</a> is still available, all the old permalinks still work.&nbsp; But the new stuff will be <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/unfiltered/">here</a>. 
In an act of what can only be called &quot;feed slamming,&quot; I'm about to
update my Feedburner account and instantly subscribe everyone over to
the new stream.&nbsp; I wouldn't exactly call it a bait and switch, since
there wasn't much &quot;bait&quot; at the old place lately.&nbsp; But I do recognize
that the change in editorial focus and frequency may freak some folks
out ...not to mention the flood of &quot;new&quot; items that I've been priming
this with over the last couple of days.&nbsp; Feel free to exercise your
right to unsubscribe, but know I'll be sorry to see you go.</p>

<p>Housekeeping things:&nbsp; the design's not &quot;done&quot; by any stretch, but
you'll get the thing I'm going for.&nbsp; I'm sure there are bugs galore,
and I know the view-source types will gasp with horror, but I optimized
for ship date...and I didn't want to bug any of the geniuses I work
with to make it perfect.&nbsp; There are, after all, only so many hours in
the day.</p>

<p>OK, then.&nbsp; Enough talking.&nbsp; Onward!</p>
