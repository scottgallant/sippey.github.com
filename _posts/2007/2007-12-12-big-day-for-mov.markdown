<p>Movable Type is <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/2007/12/movable_type_open_source.html">now available</a> under a an <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/opensource/">open source</a> license.&nbsp; Huge kudos to the entire team that's worked on this, especially Byrne Reese, Brad Choate, Chris Hall, Anil Dash, Chris Vail and Mark Simmons, who have done all the hard work in getting all the details right. And, of course, many thanks to Ben and Mena for doing their part since day zero &quot;fighting for openness,&quot; as Anil puts it so well in the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/2007/12/movable_type_open_source.html">post on movabletype.org</a>.</p>

<p>This is such a great way to bookend a tremendous year for Movable Type; I'm incredibly proud of the work we've done with MT4, and this just puts the icing on the cake. Onward!</p>
