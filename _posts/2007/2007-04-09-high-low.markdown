<p>The high / low culture conversation continues with two recently interesting bits of media.&nbsp; First, if you haven't been directed there already, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html">WashPo piece on hiring Joshua Bell to play in the Metro</a> is an incredible read.</p><blockquote><p>He was, in short, art without a frame. Which, it turns out, may have a
lot to do with what happened -- or, more precisely, what didn't happen
-- on January 12.</p></blockquote><p>From art without a frame to art with a <em>massive</em> frame, Peter Gelb, the General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera in NY was on Charlie Rose this past Friday night.&nbsp; He talked about the direction of the Met, the simulcasts they're doing into movie theaters around the world, and the demographics of the opera crowd.&nbsp; (To very roughly summarize, five years ago the average age of the Met opera goer was 60.&nbsp; It's now 65.&nbsp; Gelb clearly has his work cut out for him.)&nbsp; You can <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2337259214049341781&amp;hl=en">watch the interview on Google Video</a>; it's segment three so you'll have to fast forward a bit.&nbsp; If you're at all interested in the arts business, it's worth the time.</p>
