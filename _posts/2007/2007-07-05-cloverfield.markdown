<p>The Cloverfield trailer is still up at <a title="Dailymotion - Share Your Videos" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/videos/relevance/search/cloverfield/1">Dailymotion</a>, but was pulled by YouTube.&nbsp; Slashfilm has a <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/tag/cloverfield/">good roundup</a> of the latest about the JJ Abrams project.&nbsp; (Every report I heard from TED this year was that Abrams had one of the best talks (keywords: magic, mystery, storytelling, an unopened box); I'm hoping it goes up on <a href="http://www.ted.com/">ted.com</a> soon.)</p>
