<p>I originally posted the following to <a href="http://michael.vox.com/library/post/this-must-already-exist.html">my Vox blog</a>, with the intent of cleaning it up and posting here as a &quot;proper blog post.&quot; Alas, after all these years of doing this, I've yet to learn that the only &quot;proper blog post&quot; is a &quot;timely blog post.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>Stupid hack idea:&nbsp; a local script that pulls currently playing from one of your friends last.fm profiles and updates <em>your</em>
IM status with what they're listening to.&nbsp; Have it update in real time
for that creepy simulcast effect (&quot;OMIGOD, we're listening to the same
stuff&quot;), or have it pull from the friends' playlist archive at random
to leech off their coolness (&quot;yeah, I'm into &lt;cool hip band&gt;
too&quot;) or fake a shared interest for other purposes (&quot;I can't believe
we're both into &lt;cool hip band&gt;; we should get together some
time&quot;).</p></blockquote><p>And then today, on Buzzfeed, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzz/InterNetwork_iTunes_Romance">this</a>:</p><blockquote><p><span class="blurb">Meeting your soulmate through the playlists on your network in iTunes.</span> In the age of MySpace, Nerve.com, and scary Craigslist ads...this is actually kind of a cute way to meet people.</p></blockquote><p>Look, ma, I'm prescient!</p>
