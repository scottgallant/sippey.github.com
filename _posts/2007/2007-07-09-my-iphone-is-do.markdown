<p>With apologies to Merlin, the top five reasons <a title="July 2 - July 8, 2007 - Cartoons of the Week - TIME" href="http://www.time.com/time/cartoonsoftheweek/0,29489,1640474,00.html">this cartoon</a> makes me want to throw up a little.</p>

<ol><li>Wife badgering husband.</li>

<li>Wife badgering husband about mowing the lawn.</li>

<li>Jeans in a hammock?&nbsp; Plaid shirt?</li>

<li>The way the iPhone joke was inserted into a scenario that is just dying for a <a href="http://www.radosh.net/archive/001930.html">New Yorker Cartoon Anti-Caption contest</a>.&nbsp; (Except Radosh would have to change the contest to the Time Magazine Cartoon of the Week Anti-Caption contest.&nbsp; Which would make the contest a lot less fun for everyone involved.)</li>

<li>The fact that one prominent blogger friend of mine who shall remain nameless (he told me this off the record) sees the cartoon as a form of insider commentary on a particular popular technology columnist.&nbsp; I'll admit, though, that he was probably being &quot;ironic.&quot;&nbsp; Which is very un-iPhone, if you ask me.</li></ol>
