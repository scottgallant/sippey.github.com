<p>Jen Bekman has launched <a href="http://www.20x200.com/">20x200</a>.  Jen is one of the web's original pioneers; she and I did a stint together as community managers of Netscape.com in like 1997.  Since then she's escaped the 'net and built a wonderful art business in New York.  It's great to see her combine two of her (many) passions -- art and the web -- into this new venture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We introduce two new pieces a week: one photo and one work on paper. Each image is available in three sizes. The smallest size is reprinted in the largest batch – an edition of 200 – and sold at the lowest price – $20. Hence the name 20x200. (200x20 just didn't sound as good.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jen has a great eye, and the work that's already up is fantastic.  If you've never bought art before, maybe this is the way for you to get into collecting.</p>
