<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/arts/music/16pitc.html?_r=1&amp;ref=music&amp;oref=slogin"><p>Pitchfork draws what may be the most studious, even analytical crowd of any American rock festival. In the polite silence as the rock band Grizzly Bear tuned up between songs on Saturday afternoon, someone yelled a quintessentially Pitchfork comment: “You’re pretty good!”</p></blockquote>
