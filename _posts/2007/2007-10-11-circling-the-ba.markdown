<p>Events galore.  Last night was at the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7716">Creative Commons mixer in SF</a>, where we demo'd a new <a href="http://everything.typepad.com/cc/">CC licensing widget</a> we've built for TypePad (everything.typepad.com blog post coming soon) and presented to CC a check for $15,000+ that was raised by the LiveJournal community as part of this summer's <a href="http://news.livejournal.com/100876.html">permanent account sale</a>.  Tonight I'll be at the Silicon Valley American Marketing Association's <a href="http://www.svama.net/events/20071011mpreg.html">event on Marketing 2.0</a> in Cupertino, on a panel talking about...wait for it...blogging! That makes it a "circle the Bay" day (Berkeley --> SF --> South Bay --> Berkeley), which means at some point there will be <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/unfiltered/2007/10/another-brick.html">prog rock</a> on in the car.</p>
