<p>Muscle memory is a bitch. Especially when making the switch from desktop apps to web apps.</p>

<p>I've been alt-tabbing between applications for 15 years (1992 marked the introduction of Windows 3.1, the Version That Mattered). I've only been CTRL-tabbing between browser tabs for what, three years?&nbsp; The mental model of &quot;to switch applications, alt-tab&quot; is deeply, deeply ingrained; ctrl-tabbing between gmail, gcal, gtalk and gdocs just isn't the same.&nbsp; My recent preference for web applications is bumping up against a decade and a half of <del>repetitive motion</del> learned behavior.</p>

<p>And look, here's the comment bait:&nbsp; I know I can't be the only late-30something who's having issues adjusting to our brave new world.&nbsp; <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/unfiltered/2007/07/muscle-memory.html#comments">What's blocking you from going all web all the time</a>?</p>
