<p>Please produce an RSS feed of just images from PerezHilton.com where he's done his scribbling thing on them. Then, please turn that into a Dashboard Widget or a PerezHiltoniffic so I can keyboard shortcut to get an instant dose of <a href="http://perezhilton.com/?p=10847">images like this</a>. Thanks in advance!</p>
