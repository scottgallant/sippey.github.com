<p>Not everything gets shared on delicious, and while I love reading my friends' automated daily link posts, when I turn them on here I always feel like they're a little bit spammy, not quite filtered enough.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I like links.&nbsp; And you like links.&nbsp; So here are some links.</p>

<ul><li>You're reading Tim Goodman, right?&nbsp; The guy's on fire.&nbsp; Two great wrapups this week -- of <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=24&amp;entry_id=16807">The Sopranos</a> and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=24&amp;entry_id=16760">Lost</a>.&nbsp; (Oh, and SBJ had a <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2007/05/last_nights_los.html">great nugget</a> on Lost as well.)&nbsp; It seems all I'm talking about over on <a href="http://michael.vox.com/">Vox</a> is television, but here's something that's bugging me.&nbsp; If you're a fan, and you're not watching the night of the episode, then don't bitch about spoilers.&nbsp; All over the office today &quot;Shut up! Don't talk about Lost! I haven't watched it yet!&quot;&nbsp; Come on, people -- if you're a fan, you <em>watch</em>.</li>

<li><a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/05/delicious_for_m.html">Fred Wilson on Wesabe</a>:&nbsp; it's about social and tagging.&nbsp; I used to be a huge Quicken user (I even categorized the cash I spent -- to the dollar granularity), but am no longer.&nbsp; I keep meaning to try Wesabe, but I'm more than a little bit afraid of what I'll learn.</li>

<li>The Hatch Design Blog <a href="http://blog.designpublic.com/2007/05/23/beautiful-japanese-design-ring-house-in-japan/">featured a great pic of the Ring House</a> outside Tokyo.&nbsp; It took my breath away.</li>

<li><a href="http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html">ReCAPTCHA</a> looks cool...
</li>

<li>Kara Swisher <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20070524/facebooks-next-steps-still-to-come-a-tv-show/">on Facebook</a> is worth a read...and she outs the plans for a Facebook TV show.&nbsp; The Kara v. Arrington spat is also great sport, but not worth the href.</li>

<li>And speaking of warring factions I really wanted to watch the <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/05/13471.html">Civil War condensed down to four minutes</a>, but the video seems to have been disappeared from YouTube.</li></ul>

<p>If you didn't catch that, I just compared a silly spat between two journalists covering Web 2.0 to the most tragic war in our nation's history.&nbsp; Now <em>that's</em> blogging.</p>
