<p>This whole &quot;no Daily Show&quot; thing[1] really sucks ass.[2]</p>

<p>[1] I mean, seriously. There's a whole new <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/world/middleeast/06intel.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">National Intelligence Estimate on Iran</a> and all of us self-satisfied armchair liberals are stuck looking for the humor in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/opinion/05friedman.html?n=Top/Opinion/Editorials%20and%20Op-Ed/Op-Ed/Columnists">Tom Friedman columns</a>. Shoot me now.</p>
