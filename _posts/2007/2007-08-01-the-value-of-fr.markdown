<p>Drew McManus, who writes the excellent blog <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/adaptistration/">Adaptistration</a> on arts administration, on reports that <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/adaptistration/archives/2007/07/some_good_quest.html">free symphony concerts</a> don't drive incremental ticket sales to paid events:&nbsp; &quot;I continue to think that the real failure of most free concerts has more to do with implementation and lack of adequate interaction between attendees and representatives of the orchestra.&quot;
