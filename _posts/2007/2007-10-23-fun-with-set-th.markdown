<p>I suspect that there is a very small intersection between the set of people who appreciate <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/04/cats-can-has-gr.html">lolcats</a> and the set of people who appreciate <a href="http://twitter.com/jennyholzer">Jenny Holzer</a>. If, like me, you find yourself in that intersection, <a href="http://djchall.vox.com/library/posts/tags/loljennyholzer/">you will most likely appreciate these loljennyholzers</a>.</p>
