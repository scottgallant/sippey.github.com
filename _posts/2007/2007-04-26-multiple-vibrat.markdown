<p>I think Charlie Schick has Twittered about this, but as I get more and more SMS traffic, it would be great if my phone supported multiple vibrate patterns, a la ringtones.&nbsp; (I always have my phone on vibrate, because in I have an impossible time actually hearing my phone ring.&nbsp; Either I'm getting older (speak up, sonny) or I'm deliberately ignoring incoming calls.)</p>

<p>Here's what I want.</p>

<ul><li>Bzzt == twitter or other automated SMS.</li>

<li>Bzzt bzzt == SMS from an actual human.</li>

<li>Bzzt bzzt bzzt == phone call.</li>

<li>Special pattern of bzzt's == phone call from someone special</li></ul>

<p>Couldn't be that hard, could it?</p>
