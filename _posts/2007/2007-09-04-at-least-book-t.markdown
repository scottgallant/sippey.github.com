<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/09/virtual-book-tours-the-origins-of">Kottke</a> (and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzz/Virtual_Book_Tours">Buzzfeed</a>! and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/fashion/02blog.html?ex=1346299200&amp;en=988f9e2ea5809708&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">New York Times</a>!) on virtual book tours, which would have been the more appropriate option for the guy hawking his September 11 historical fiction / conspiracy theory tome at McCarran Interational Airport in Las Vegas last week.
