<p>Slate's Mickey Kaus on the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2178626/">cop out</a> of covering candidate &quot;electability.&quot;

</p><blockquote cite="http://www.slate.com/id/2178626/"><p>&quot;Who's electable&quot; is a Neutral Story Line--it seemingly doesn't require reporters and publications to take stands or sides. You can write dozens of &quot;Is Hillary Electable?&quot; stories without letting on what you think about, say, government-guaranteed health care. It's harder to write &quot;Will Hillary be a Good President?&quot; without doing that.</p></blockquote>
