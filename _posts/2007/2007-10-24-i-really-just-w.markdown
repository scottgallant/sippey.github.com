<p>There's nothing better than chatting with customers...especially when you're reading their book at the same time. (OK, not at <em>exactly</em> the same time. You know what I mean.) Now on Everything TypePad, <a href="http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2007/10/a-brief-intervi.html">a brief interview with Alex Ross</a>.&nbsp; (And that, ladies and gentlemen, makes Ross the direct or indirect subject of three of the last five posts here. I'll move on soon, I swear.)</p>
