<p>It's early morning, and I'm walking through the Southwest Florida International Airport, doing my best to ignore the piped in Muzak.&nbsp; But the task becomes impossible when a watered down version of Billy Joel's &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; comes on.&nbsp; It's astonishing, but it is actually possible to water that song down.</p>

<p>I know there are a myriad of complicated licensing and performance rights issues that have brought us to the point where early morning travelers catch themselves singing &quot;Don't go changing to try to please me&quot; in time with an anonymous female song stylist.&nbsp; But because I'm generally boring and single-tracked, I'm sitting here wondering what the online equivalent to Muzak is. F8? Widgets? RSS Readers? The mobile web? My Yahoo? The entire AOL experience?&nbsp; When we add value do we water down? You've gotta believe that the people programming the Muzak channels believe they're doing Good Work, just like you.</p>

<p>Note to self: blog posts from airport terminals always <em>seem</em> like a good idea.</p>
