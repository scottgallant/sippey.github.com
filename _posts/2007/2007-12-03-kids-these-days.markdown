<p>From Slate's <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2179047/">review</a> of Steve Martin's new book comes this depressing tidbit:&nbsp; &quot;According to the census bureau, roughly 40 percent of the American populace was born after 1981, which means that Steve Martin has not been a stand-up comedian in their lifetime.&quot;</p>

<p>This was the review's <em>lede</em>. I had to simply stop reading; it was just too depressing. I have no idea whether or not they thought the book was any good.</p>
