<p>Dear Lazyweb.  Please produce a detailed comparison (with screenshots, please!) of <a href="http://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> and <a href="http://www.wesabe.com/">Wesabe</a>.  It's about time I channel my (former) inner-Quicken-user to the web, and I don't have the time / patience to try both of them.  (Well, actually, I did have time to attempt Mint yesterday afternoon, but their <a href="http://corporate.yodlee.com/">Yodlee</a> connector must have been overwhelmed with new users because connections to my external accounts timed out and they told me to try again later.)</p>
