<p>Small Macintosh OS X Leopard hint, first in a series of one, because I usually don't do this kind of thing. If you have a local mail folder named &quot;notes&quot; you need to rename it before Mail will let you save a new note you create.&nbsp; Otherwise you will get an error message that reads &quot;The note could not be saved.&quot; May legions of Leopard users find this blog post through the wonders of Google and save themselves just a little bit of time.</p>
