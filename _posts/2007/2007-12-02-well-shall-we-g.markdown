<p>Saturday's Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/arts/design/02cott.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1196661257-hsM1VQxolNT3IcJETqu3EA">profiled artist Paul Chan</a> and his work in New Orleans, especially his <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jonnodotcom/1859053560/">outdoor stagings</a> of Waiting for Godot in the Lower Ninth and Gentilly neighborhoods. I loved the description, though of the signs Chan <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jonnodotcom/1849834693/in/set-72057594137279199/">put up all over the city</a>, in advance of the performances...</p><blockquote><p>Sometime in October, new words began to appear. Printed on small cardboard signs, they consisted of the same three phrases: “A country road. A tree. Evening.” — an exact quotation of Beckett’s scene-setting for “Godot.”</p>

<p>The signs were designed by Mr. Chan and posted all over the city, in a distribution pattern that had a rhythm of surprise. Drive through a “good” neighborhood or a “bad” neighborhood and you’d spot one. At a traffic light, another one. On the boarded window of an abandoned shopping mall, another.</p>

<p>After a while the signs came to feel like a shared secret, or some bounteous but anonymous civic gift, the way Keith Haring’s subway paintings felt in New York in the early 1980s. They added up to a visual network, art as a connective tissue for a torn-apart town.</p></blockquote><p>The whole piece is worth reading, as is <a href="http://blog.nola.com/davidcuthbert/2007/11/artist_paul_chan_brings_his_go.html">this one from Doug MacCash and David Cuthbert</a> of the Times-Picayune.</p>
