<p>So there's apparently an <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/02/19/DDGDFO5N2Q1.DTL">indeterminate future for Aaron Sorkin's <em>Studio 60</em></a>, where &quot;indeterminate&quot; means that the show most likely won't get renewed for next year, and it's currently unclear whether NBC will even air the remaining episodes. (Yes, the ratings have been <em>that bad</em>, and the show reportedly costs more than $3mm an episode to produce.)&nbsp; Tim Goodman (linked above) does a good job outlining the problems with the show (a flawed premise, a show about comedy that wasn't funny, a series of bad casting decisions), but&nbsp; I have to give props to <a href="http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=3143647&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=7200468">Hugin on the Television Without Pity forums</a> for his take...</p><blockquote><p>If you launch with an extended Network-esque rant about the state of TV
(including actual namechecks of Paddy Chayevsky), then proceed to
repeatedly declare your main characters brilliant saviors, then go on
several extended riffs on your disdain for reality TV and every small
mind that slighted you, the writer, in your professional career, make
dozens of pedantic (if not always actually correct) references to drive
home just how smart everyone is, and generally dump a steaming
truckload of hubris on your show's front yard and then plant your flag,
then <em>you'd better fucking bring it.</em></p>

<p>And Sorkin didn't.</p></blockquote><p>I'm hoping Sorkin finds another TV vehicle soon, lest our national broadcast airwaves go without their recommended weekly allowance of&nbsp; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pediconferencing">pediconferencing</a>.</p>
