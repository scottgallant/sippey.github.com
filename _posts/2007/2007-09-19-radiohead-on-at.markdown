<p>News to me, but Radiohead's catalog isn't available on iTunes.  Instead, <a href="http://www.ateaseweb.com/2007/09/18/radiohead-catalogue-available-in-high-quality-download/">they're on ateaseweb.com</a>, with full albums available in DRM free 320kbs MP3s.  The statement from EMI is interesting:  "iTunes insists that all its albums are sold unbundled, but 7digital doesnâ€™t. Radiohead prefer to have their albums sold complete. The artist has a choice, and if they feel strongly then we respect that." (Via <a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/">TRIN</a>.)</p>
