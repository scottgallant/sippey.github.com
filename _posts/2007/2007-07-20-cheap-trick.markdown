<p>OMG, book editors in England fail to identify anonymously submitted sample chapters and book summaries as being <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2129738,00.html">lifted from Jane Austen</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;I was staggered. Here is one of the greatest writers that has lived,
with her oeuvre securely fixed in the English canon and yet only one
recipient recognised them as Austen's work.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>This guy had a book he had actually written rejected out of hand, so he knew that over-the-transom work will rarely get read by publishers or agents.&nbsp; So I'm filing this one under &quot;cheap trick.&quot;</p>
