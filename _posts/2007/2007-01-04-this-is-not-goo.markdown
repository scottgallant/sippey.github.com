<p>Tim Goodman, TV writer and possibly the most compelling reason to read the SF Chronicle, is <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=24&amp;entry_id=12268">threatening to shutter The Bastard Machine</a>, his blog on SFGate.com.&nbsp; &quot;Now that I'm back at work, I'm really, truly going to work on not blogging. So much, I mean. I don't think they'll let me stop. I'm told that's the future.&quot; I trust that this is just one of those &quot;blogger phases&quot; that everyone links to but I'm too lazy to Google.</p>
