<p>For the first time ever I'll be attending SXSW.&nbsp; (If you have vague memories of drinking margaritas with me in Texas at some point during Bubble 1.0, you're probably remembering Miller Freeman's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991013014125/http://mfweb.com/">Web Austin show in October 1999</a>, back when Andrew Beebe was still doing Internet stuff (covering Google with solar panels doesn't really count), Eric Lunt wasn't burning feeds, Molly Steenson was &quot;on fire&quot; about Scient, and I was working for competitor Viant.&nbsp; Ahhh...good times.)</p>

<p>At any rate, I'll be there Sunday afternoon through Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp; I'm on two panels on Tuesday.&nbsp; At 11:30 am it'll be <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060111">After Bust 2.0: Ten Years Later Where Will We Be</a> with host Lane Becker; and at 2:00 pm it will be <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060244">There's No Such Thing as the Mobile Web (or is there)</a> with host Bob Morgan from Shozu. Should be fun.&nbsp; Thankfully, I'm not as stressed about what to pack as fellow Bust 2.0 panelist David Hornik was about <a href="http://tedblog.typepad.com/tedblog/2007/03/packing_for_ted.html">packing for TED</a>.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you'll be there and want to catch up, drop me a line.</p>
