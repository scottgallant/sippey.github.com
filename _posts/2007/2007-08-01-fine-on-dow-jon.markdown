<p>Business Week's <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jul2007/db20070731_958925.htm">Jon Fine on the Dow Jones two tier stock structure</a>:&nbsp; &quot;This insulated the <cite>Journal</cite> from some of the harsher,
short-term demands of the market. It also insulated Dow Jones'
management from feeling market pressure to make any moves that might
have made the company biggerâ€”and thus much harder for News Corp. to
swallow.&quot;</p>
