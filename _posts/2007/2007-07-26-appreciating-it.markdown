<p>I love A.O. Scott's <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/movies/27simp.html?ref=arts">review of The Simspons Movie</a> because he makes absolutely no bones about being an unabashed fan of the series. &quot;Letâ€™s keep things in perspective. 'The Simpsons' is an inexhaustible repository of humor, invention and insight, an achievement without precedent or peer in the history of broadcast television, perhaps the purest distillation of our glories and failings as a nation ever conceived. 'The Simpsons Movie' is, well, a movie.&quot;&nbsp; Worth reading in its entirety.</p>
