<p>Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche will be <a href="http://www.sfjazz.org/concerts/2007/fall/artists/KronosKotche.asp">performing</a> with Kronos Quartet as part of the SF Jazz festival in October.  They'll be premiering a new piece by Kotche, "Anomaly."  Looking forward to that.  As Anil says, drummers always love the drummers.</p>
