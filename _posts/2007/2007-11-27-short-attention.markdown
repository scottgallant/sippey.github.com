<p>Note to self:&nbsp; you have a very short attention span, as measured in the meantime between overhauls of your blog's look and feel.&nbsp; Short story:&nbsp; I fell in love with one of the new themes that Walt had put together for TypePad, and just had to apply it here.&nbsp; Oh, and I'm sure there will be all sorts of Google weirdness with the flipping back and forth with the content on /unfiltered and now here back on /filtered, but we'll suffer through. I know everyone liked the new look (so did I!) but there's something comfortable and familiar about two-column right.</p>

<p>Anyway, we're back <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/">here</a> for now.</p>
