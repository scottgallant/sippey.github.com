<p>Was reminded tonight of <a href="http://www.remem.org/">Remem</a>, the Rememberance Agent plugin for emacs.&nbsp; Bradley Rhodes' original paper was written in 1996; by now this should be a feature of every popular operating system.&nbsp; Option a: this problem is harder than it looks.&nbsp; Option b: this is a problem that the market doesn't have.&nbsp; Option c: this is a problem the market doesn't know it has, until someone comes along and solves it for them in an elegant and intuitive way.&nbsp; (Did I hear someone say &quot;next gen Google productivity apps?&quot;)</p>
