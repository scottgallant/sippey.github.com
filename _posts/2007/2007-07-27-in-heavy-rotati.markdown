<p>Recommended: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000PY32CE/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/">The Mix-Up from Beastie Boys</a>.&nbsp; From Jason Kirk's Amazon review:&nbsp; &quot;The Beastie Boys now bring what feels like their emeritus recording, a celebratory instrumental memoir of all of the influences (except punk) that brought them to their secure place among hip-hop's fickle elite.&quot;&nbsp; And yes, they sell it at Starbucks.&nbsp; In fact, I hope they sell a <em>lot</em> of them at Starbucks.</p>
