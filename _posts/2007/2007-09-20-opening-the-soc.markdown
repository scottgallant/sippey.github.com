<p>David Recordon, who's back (<a href="http://michael.vox.com/library/photo/6a00b8ea067508dece00e398a88ef50003.html">in force</a>) at Six Apart blogs about one of the things we're contributing to at Six Apart:  <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2007/09/were_opening_th.html">opening the social graph</a>.  It's long but worth the read (and the time for the screencasts); David does a great job of putting all of the work that's happening around the web on OpenID, hCard, XFN and FOAF into a user-centered context.  The goal is making it easy to discover and connect with people across networks.  "An open social graph is just as important as an open identity."</p>
