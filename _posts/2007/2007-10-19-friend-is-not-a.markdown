title: "friend is not a verb"

<p>Spent a little bit of time at the Web 2.0 summit this afternoon, with the express intent of catching the following early afternoon lineup:&nbsp; Kedrosky, Butterfield, Recordon &amp; Fitzpatrick and then Safa Rashtchy's panel discussion with a group of baby boomers about how they use the web. Kedrosky convinced me that I need to learn more about <a href="http://www.advancedtrading.com/directories/darkpool/">dark pools</a>; Stewart showed off some really sexy new photo mapping features coming soon to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, and Safa's panel was as entertaining and enlightening as ever.&nbsp; (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=-2ep2ivmaBE">This couple</a> was on the panel, and they were <em>great</em>.)</p>

<p>I'm admittedly biased, but the highlight for me was David and Brad. They did a great job of laying out the problem of closed social networks: as more and more applications benefit from social interaction,
connecting those apps to an appropriate set of your friends will become a more
frequent occurrence. In short, soon you will be very very tired of using the word &quot;friend&quot; as a verb, if you're not already.</p>

<p>The solution is a combination of a technology tools, a mindset change, and user education.&nbsp; The technology stuff is basically there -- XFN, FOAF and OAuth, for example -- and is being demonstrated now in the <a href="http://updates.elsewhere.im/">Six Apart Relationship Update Stream</a> that David announced today. The mindset change requires social network operators to open up that data, which will come, even if it takes a while. The education piece is about providing simple user experiences that (a) teach users how this works and (b) shows them the value of expressing at least a portion of their graph publicly and (c) allows them to control and maintain their relationship data.</p>

<p>David's got a post up on <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/web2summit_soci_1.html">O'Reily Radar</a> that summarizes their talk; it's a good followup to his post on <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2007/09/were_opening_th.html">Opening the Social Graph</a> at sixapart.com.</p>
