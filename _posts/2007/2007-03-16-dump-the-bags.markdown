<p>A hearty +1 to Dale Dougherty's post <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/bag_the_schwag.html">Bag the Schwag</a>.&nbsp; In Austin this week all I wanted from the bag was the tiny conference guide that I could fold up and stick in my pocket or inside my badge; the rest of it was just wasted promotional material.&nbsp; And when I told the bag people this, they were literally shocked.&nbsp; &quot;You mean you don't want all these magazines?&nbsp; Look at all these great magazines!&quot;&nbsp; And then after I convinced them that No, I didn't want the magazines, they told me I <em>had</em> to take at least the full-size program (along with the micro-sized one) because, and I kid you not, &quot;people sell them for thirty bucks on eBay.&quot;&nbsp; The program went back in the bag.<br /> </p>

<p>Other highlights of Austin:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/">Henry Jenkins</a>; catching up with &quot;easterners&quot; <a href="http://www.bryanboyer.com/">Bryan Boyer</a>, <a href="http://www.girlwonder.com/">Molly Steenson</a> and the <a href="http://hesketh.com/about/leadership.html">Hesketh</a> crew; our panel on <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060111">After Bust 2.0</a> (&quot;How many of you are here because you're afraid of losing your jobs?&quot;); general twitter mania; having the <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060244">mobile web panel</a> I was on scheduled opposite of Will Wright's Spore demo (gah!); contributing to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Partial_Attention">continuous partial attention</a> by phoning Jason Shellen while Heather Gold was interviewing him about the same; meeting a bunch of great MT, TypePad, Vox and LJ bloggers; and the lightning show on Sunday night.&nbsp; Wow...a real thunderstorm!&nbsp; We don't get those out here very often.</p>
