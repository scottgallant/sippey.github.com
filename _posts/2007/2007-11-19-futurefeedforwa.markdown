<p>Holy cow, <a href="http://futurefeedforward.com/">futurefeedforward</a> lives! My inbox told me that &quot;<a href="http://futurefeedforward.com/front.php?fid=103">Socal Skyfires Torch Subprime Skytellites</a>.&quot;</p>

<blockquote><p>The airborne fires, some of which have burned for more than nine days, are fueled by thermobaric clouds of atomized landfill and other condensing nano-particulates disbursed into the upper atmosphere by disposal units commonly used in the county's tethered, low-earth-orbit neighborhoods. The roiling clouds of burning waste-vapor have been described by local witnesses as both &quot;apocalyptic&quot; and &quot;breathtaking.&quot; &quot;I mean, I've seen the entire rainbow in those fires,&quot; notes William Lennox, 43, a Plato Verde dentist and father of two. &quot;The heat is incredible, and the smell, but the colors are really what gets you. The sky is literally burning, but the colors are just amazing.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>They're also working on <a href="http://futurefeedforward.com/novel.php">a novel</a>.<br /></p>
