<p>Stephanie DiMarco, CEO of <a href="http://www.advent.com/">Advent Software</a> (and my old boss) tells the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/business/yourmoney/26boss.html">story of starting, leaving and coming back to the company</a> in the Sunday Times.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not only was I young, I looked young. It was a challenge to be taken seriously. I was at a trade show when I overheard a competitor talking about Advent. He said, "It’s that little company in California run by that little girl." I wasn’t going to let it get me down. I turned it into an advantage. As the public face of the business, one that people didn’t expect, I was able to surprise a lot of customers. That competitor is no longer in business.</p>
