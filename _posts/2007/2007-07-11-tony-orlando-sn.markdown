<p>From Tim Goodman's coverage of <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=24&amp;entry_id=18433">Death March with Cocktails</a>:</p><blockquote>

<p>Alright, so I'm just going to confess this. I thought Tony Orlando was dead.&nbsp; Orlando: &quot;I was canceled with a 32 share.&quot; Great line. And probably true. I'm too stunned that he's alive and breathing to look it up.</p></blockquote>
