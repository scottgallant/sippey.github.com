<p>From this weekend's &quot;Adventures with Tivo,&quot; Charlie Rose had <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2007/11/16/1/a-discussion-about-the-film-no-country-for-old-men">Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and the Coen brothers on</a> to discuss No Country for Old Men. Worth the time, even though it's, you know, Charlie Rose.</p>
