<p>Microsoft <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/business/media/19soft-web.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">buys aQuantive</a> for $6 billion.&nbsp; And chiming in with the best instant analysis is Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott 
Devitt (via <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSN1848846720070518">Reuters</a>):</p><blockquote><p> &quot;It lowers the probability that Microsoft is buying Yahoo, 
at least in the near-term. Microsoft may be more interested in piecemealing together 
the highest-quality franchises that replicate what Yahoo 
already has.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>What I love about this is the ANDness of it.&nbsp; The recognition that growth for MSFT in online advertising will need to come both from their own online properties (MSN, LIve, etc.) and from sites out of their control.&nbsp; And yes, Google's recognized this for a while...<br /> </p>
