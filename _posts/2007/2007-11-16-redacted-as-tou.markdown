<p>A.O. Scott <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/movies/16reda.html?8dpc">on Brian DePalma's new movie</a>, &quot;Redacted.&quot;</p>

<blockquote cite="http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/movies/16reda.html?8dpc"><p>An unrivaled master of showy cinematic technique, he has made a film whose governing conceit is that it is not a film at all but rather a palimpsest of found video culled from consumer-grade camcorders, surveillance cameras, cellphones and Web sites. (There are also snippets from a French documentary, a mischievous parody complete with portentous music and solemn narration.) “Redacted” takes us on a tour not only of the battlefield, but also of the modern media environment, where no moment goes unrecorded and where everyone is, at least potentially, a filmmaker.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not planning on seeing &quot;Redacted&quot; in the theater for a variety of reasons (&quot;I don't get out much and I'd rather spend babysitter money on 'No Country for Old Men'&quot; being the leading contender), but I wish there were&nbsp; way to experience this tour of &quot;the modern media environment&quot; <em>in that actual environment.</em></p>
