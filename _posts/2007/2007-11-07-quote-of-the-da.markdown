<p>From Todd Thompson, Citi's ousted head of wealth management, on <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/ousted-citi-executive-todd-thomson-fires-back/index.html?hp">the fish tank</a> in his office that was dubbed the Todd Mahal (the office, not the fish tank):&nbsp; “If that gives me a little bit of a leg up with three or four Chinese billionaires, I think I’ve paid for the goldfish bowl.” </p>
