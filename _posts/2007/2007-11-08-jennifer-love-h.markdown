<p>You know it will be a good day when The Cold Inclusive posts more in the ongoing adventures of Jennifer Love Hewitt.&nbsp; Today <a href="http://inclusive.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/joel-turnipseed-interviews-cory-doctorow-and-jennifer-love-hewitt/">our protagonist is being interviewed alongside Cory Doctorow</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://inclusive.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/joel-turnipseed-interviews-cory-doctorow-and-jennifer-love-hewitt/"><p><strong>CD:</strong> I guess it depends on the kind of profit and
how they’re profiting by it. I don’t get upset if a carpenter sells a
bookcase to someone and makes money because that person needs somewhere
to put my book. Even though that carpenter is benefiting from my labor.</p>
<p><strong>JLH:</strong> You did not just say that. Cory honey, if you want to change people’s mind about something, you have to use examples from <em>this planet</em> to illustrate your point.</p></blockquote>
