<p>Recommended for road trips with kids, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811837335/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/">Rubberneckers Jr: Fun for Backseat Travelers</a>.&nbsp; You can't leave them plugged into the DVD player the entire time, and in this card-based game players score points when they spot something (like a police car, a tanker truck, a triangle-shaped sign, the number four).
