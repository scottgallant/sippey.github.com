<p>Remember the Google / AOL deal of December 2005?  One of the bullet points in the <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/twaol_expanded.html">press release</a> was the announcement of "enabling Google Talk and AIM instant messaging users to communicate with each other, provided certain conditions are met."  I'd love to find out what those conditions were, and what so far has prevented them from being met.  A boy can still dream of <a href="http://www.imfederation.com/">federated</a> AIM, can't he?</p>
