<p>I don't have much to add to the &quot;Google Office&quot; discussion, except to add this note to <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/08/google_apps_and.html">Chris Anderson's plea</a> for the ability to embed spreadsheets in pages like you can embed YouTube videos.&nbsp; We've actually had these before, courtesy of HalfBrain.com, which I <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1999/12/20.html">wrote about</a> back in 1999 during Bubble 1.0.</p><blockquote><p>Written entirely in DHTML, Brain Matter provides the 20% of the
functionality of Excel that 80% of the market uses 100% of the time --
all in your browser. It's fast, it's clean, it's intuitive -- and it's
smart. HalfBrain clearly knows that when you migrate an application to
the network, it opens up new ways to use that application. First,
they've enabled network-based storage of the spreadsheets you create
(of course). Second, their site helps shift focus from the tool itself
to the <em>use</em> of the tool, by publishing more than 200 interactive
calculators that help users do simple tasks like track expenses, plan a
party or calculate the value of their options. Finally, they've flipped
the viral bit, making it incredibly easy to email a spreadsheet to a
friend, or to post a calculator on your own website.</p></blockquote><p>The folks behind HalfBrain ended up doing a little thing called Oddpost, and you know the rest of that <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">story</a>...</p>
