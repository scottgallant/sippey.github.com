<p>I picked up&nbsp; The Beatles <em>Love</em> over the weekend, and on each listen it literally surprises me.&nbsp; Leaving aside for a moment whether this is a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; thing, the record is an object lesson in Jeff Hawkins' memory-prediction framework as outlined in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Intelligence">On Intelligence</a>.&nbsp; Your brain, wired for years to expect one thing, gets something else entirely, triggering the &quot;whoa&quot; response.</p>

<p>It's impossible to listen to the record as &quot;background music&quot; while trying to perform other tasks, because your brain keeps interrupting you with &quot;you need to pay attention to <em>this</em> thing over <em>here</em>.&quot; While remixes aren't anything new, the deep grooves the original tracks have worn inside any Beatles fan's head makes listening to <em>Love</em> a very different experience. </p>
