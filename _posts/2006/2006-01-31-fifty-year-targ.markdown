<p>Everyone will of course be talking about the Google &quot;miss.&quot;&nbsp; Looking beyond the schadenfreude for a second, what's still really astounding is the lack of consensus on the street about where the goog's headed.&nbsp; Here's the last sentence of the story from <a title="today.reuters.com" href="http://today.reuters.com/business/newsarticle.aspx?type=ousiv&amp;storyID=2006-01-31T231633Z_01_WEN9305_RTRIDST_0_BUSINESSPRO-GOOGLE-EARNS-DC.XML">today.reuters.com</a>:</p><blockquote cite="http://today.reuters.com/business/newsarticle.aspx?type=ousiv&amp;storyID=2006-01-31T231633Z_01_WEN9305_RTRIDST_0_BUSINESSPRO-GOOGLE-EARNS-DC.XML"><p>Target prices on the stock vary between $225 and $600. Twenty-nine analysts have some sort of &quot;buy&quot; rating. Six have a &quot;hold&quot; rating. Three recommend investors &quot;sell&quot; Google shares.</p></blockquote><p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Was in Disneyland weekend before last with my family and my younger brother.&nbsp; Disneyland is celebrating its 50th anniversary; and they've had plenty of time to get an awful lot of things right about the park.&nbsp; This led to a post-Autopia question of &quot;What's Google in 50 years?&quot;&nbsp; (Interesting to note that 50 years is roughly two orders of magnitude out from a near term price target.)</p>

<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">(Won't please someone tag me with that &quot;four questions&quot; thing so I can do something other than think about Google in 50 years?&nbsp; Anil today, over lunch:&nbsp; &quot;Sippey? Does he still have a blog?&quot;)</p>
