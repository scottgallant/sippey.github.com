<p>And there was much rejoicing, for today marks the return of <a href="http://interconnected.org/dirk/">Dirk</a>, which celebrates the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.&nbsp; Soooooper genius Matt Webb <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2006/08/24/dirk_is_back">writes</a>...</p><blockquote><p>I've rewritten Dirk for my own learning a few times, in Perl again, PHP
and Python. It's my Hello World app, hitting web apps, databases,
general syntax, algorithms and performance. I try to write it as
idiomatically as possible each time, and squeezing every drop of
performance out of the pathfinding algorithm (which I know pretty well
by now) lets me learn what's fast and slow in each language.</p></blockquote><p>Dirk is one hell of a Hello World app.&nbsp; Go play!&nbsp; Connect!&nbsp; Pathfind!</p>
