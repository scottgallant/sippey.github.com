<p>I can't stand the comments and the posts are only moderately interesting, but what's still entertaining about Slashdot (after all these years) are the departments.&nbsp; As in the story about <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/06/07/05/1557222.shtml">Kenneth Lay's death</a> coming from the <em>so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-sarbox</em> dept.&nbsp; So please, won't someone construct me a custom feed that mashes the title of the item and the department it comes from into one long title for quick and easy LiveBookmarks or Google Toolbar scanning?&nbsp; Heck, their feed already has the custom &lt;slash:department&gt; namespace you'd need; it almost transforms itself.[1]</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">[1] Dear God (a separate entity from the Lazyweb, to be sure), please shoot me.&nbsp; I made an XSLT joke.&nbsp; In a post about Slashdot.</span></p>
