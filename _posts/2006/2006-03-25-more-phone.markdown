<p>Different strokes for <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_phone_the_moto_pebl.php">different folks</a>:&nbsp; I'd probably find the Motorola PEBL <em>(Won't somebody please start using vowels again? Do it for the kids; a generation can't be raised on consonants alone...)</em> utterly boring.&nbsp; Proof -- I just finished my first week with a new <a href="http://www.cingular.com/8125_consumer">Cingular 8125</a> (aka the HTC Wizard), and it's pretty damn great.&nbsp; It's about the size of the Treo 650 (without the antenna), has a slideout keyboard, a big touchscreen, wifi, Edge, a 1.3MP camera, an accessible miniSD slot, etc.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not for everyone:</p>

<ol><li>You should not have an allergy to Microsoft products.&nbsp; That rules out those different folks who think different. Ly.</li>

<li>Related to number 1 above, you best be using Exchange, with an IT department (or outsourced provider) who lets you sync over the air with ActiveSync.&nbsp; (OTA ActiveSync is absolutely brilliant.&nbsp; Step one:&nbsp; take phone out of box.&nbsp; Step two:&nbsp; configure sync URL, username and password, press sync.&nbsp; Step three:&nbsp; enjoy up to date calendar, contacts and inbox.&nbsp; Forever.)</li>

<li>You should have nimble thumbs.&nbsp; <br />
</li></ol>

<p>Note that numbers 2 and 3 describe a nice slice of corporate America that is laying the track for RIM's gravy train.&nbsp; Something tells me that ride's gonna end soon, esp. with the update to Exchange which pushes email proactively to Windows Mobile 5 devices.</p>
