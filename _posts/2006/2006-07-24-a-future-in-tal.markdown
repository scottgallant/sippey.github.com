<p>I'm not about to quit my day job, but I must admit that doing today's <a href="http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2006/07/chat_with_chris.html">Skypecast with Chris Anderson</a> (in case you haven't heard, he's written this <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/">pretty popular book</a>) was a ton of fun.&nbsp; We had about 50 people on the call, and I think juggling the questions from the participants with my own list of <del>layups</del> insightful, probing questions worked out pretty well. Of course, Chris will probably never speak to me again, and the folks on the call were probably hoping for a more &quot;head of the tail&quot; type host...</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp; you can listen to the whole thing <a href="http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2006/07/listen_to_our_c.html">here</a>.</p>
