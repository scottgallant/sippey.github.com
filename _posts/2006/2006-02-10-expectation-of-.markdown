<p>I don't know about you, but I generally operate from the assumption that <a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/000945.html">conversations I have with another person</a> are &quot;<a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?ctx=%67mail&amp;hl=en&amp;answer=29291">off the record</a>&quot;[1] unless we both explicitly agree that they're &quot;on the record.&quot;[2]</p>

<p>[1] Default settings matter.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; Especially when the defaults are set 180 degrees from the user's mental model.<br />[2] What's the IM equivalent of the ever-present &quot;this call may be monitored or recorded for quality purposes?&quot;</p>
