<p>I take it back – <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2006/02/hell_is_chrome.html">hell isn’t chrome</a>, and chrome isn’t hell.&nbsp; And while it’s not quite heaven, over the few days that I’ve been running Beta 2 of Office 2007, I’ve grown more and more impressed with what they’ve done with the UI.
</p>

<ul><li><div>Even though it takes up an awful lot of real estate, the ribbon <em>works.</em>&nbsp; I’ve been undoing years of Office muscle memory, and have been enjoying the relearning process along the way.
</div></li>

<li><div>The task grouping works, and the information hierarchy of default tasks = big buttons also works.
</div></li>

<li><div>The todo bar is fantastic -- my inbox, my next appointment and my task list all in one view.&nbsp; It doesn’t take much to make me happy, and this makes me happy.
</div></li>

<li><div>Word has some particularly nice touches, including a constantly updating word count in the status bar.&nbsp; And while you can pry my beloved TypePad from my cold dead hands, I’m actually composing this from Word’s built-in blogging client.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</div></li></ul>

<p>There are a few things that I wish it had…
</p>

<ul><li><div>Outlook items (messages, contacts, appointments) get the ribbon, but not the main app.&nbsp; I’m hoping they address this before release, but I have a feeling that we won’t be seeing major updates to that part of the UI before RTM. 
</div></li>

<li><div>The ribbon has great defaults, but I miss having <em>some</em> customization options.&nbsp; Like making one of the actions in a group the default, in order to make its target icon that much bigger.&nbsp; I love the big delete button on messages, but would also love a big “move to folder” button.&nbsp; I recognize you can’t please everyone.
</div></li>

<li><div>The blue theme is too blue, and the black theme is too black.&nbsp; And is Vista really all that black? 
</div></li></ul>

<p>And here are some things to look out for…
</p>

<ul><li><div>I’m running a late model ThinkPad with a 1GB of RAM, and the apps can get a bit pokey.&nbsp; &nbsp;So installer beware.
</div></li>

<li><div>For whatever reason, searchindexer.exe is a memory <em>hog</em>.&nbsp; It installs a Control Panel item to configure it; I toned it down to only index my email, and that’s helped a ton.&nbsp; 
</div></li>

<li><div>Make sure you’re paying attention to file formats when you’re saving your docs, otherwise your colleagues will be out luck trying to open your .docx, .pptx or .xlsx files.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can set your preference to save in the older file format, but that’s not set by default.
</div></li></ul>

<p>You can get the beta for yourself <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/beta/getthebeta.mspx">here</a>.</p>
