<p>Turnhere.com has a great short (3:47) video on the <a href="http://www.turnhere.com/city/san_francisco/berkeley_east_bay/films/9.aspx">Gourmet Ghetto</a> in Berkeley; the eight square blocks of foodie heaven just up the street from where we live.&nbsp; (The guy in the beret is a fixture outside the original Peet's; he's about as Berkeley as you can get.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>See also, in case you haven't read it already, Michael Chabon's fantastic essay <a href="http://www.michaelchabon.com/archives/2005/03/the_mysteries_o.html">The Mysteries of Berkeley</a>.</p>
