<p>My sincere apologies to anyone stuck in Bay Bridge traffic between about 8:30 and 9:00 this morning.&nbsp; That was me in the dark blue Passat whose alternator failed just after crossing Treasure Island.&nbsp; There's nothing like being stuck at a dead stop in the second lane from the left and watching in your rear view mirror the traffic stack up behind you...</p>
