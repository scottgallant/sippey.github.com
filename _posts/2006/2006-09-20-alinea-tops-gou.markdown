<p>Congrats to Grant Aschatz and my friend Nick Kokonas of Chicago's <a href="http://www.alinea-restaurant.com/">Alinea</a> for topping Gourmet's list of the 50 best restaurants in America (via <a href="http://www.megnut.com/2006/09/gourmet-names-alinea-number-one">Megnut</a>). </p>

<p>I had the privilege of eating there this summer <em>(eating's not really the right word for it...and I've been called pretentious but I'm not quite pretentious enough to use the verb &quot;to dine&quot;)</em>, and enjoyed <em>(again...with Alinea &quot;experienced&quot; is probably the better word)</em> the best meal of my life.&nbsp; And then the next day Nick and I grabbed lunch and he told the greatest stories about meeting Chef Aschatz, lining up investors, renovating the building[1], marketing the concept, etc. I couldn't be happier for Nick and crew -- they've built something truly amazing in an incredibly short period of time.</p>

<p>[1] If you ever meet Nick, ask him to tell you the story of how he tiled the <del>entryway</del> basement of the restaurant himself in one all-nighter, just to show his contractor that &quot;this is what it means to get shit done.&quot;</p>
