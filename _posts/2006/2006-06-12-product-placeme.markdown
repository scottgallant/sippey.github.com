<p>It was only a matter of time:  <a title="Product Placement Deals Make Leap From Film to Books - New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/12/business/media/12book.html">Product Placement Deals Make Leap From Film to Books</a>, reports the Times.</p>

<blockquote>Cover Girl, which is owned by the consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, has neither paid the publisher nor the book's authors, Sean Stewart and Jordan Weisman, for the privilege of having their makeup showcased in the novel <em>(titled "Cathy's Book: If Found Call (650) 266-8233")</em>. But Procter will promote the book on Beinggirl.com, a Web site directed at adolescent girls that has games, advice on handling puberty and, yes, makeup tips.</blockquote>

<p>This particular execution sounds fairly straightforward; I'd love to see someone like William Gibson or Doug Coupland take product placement straight on and work it into a novel...  Imagine <em>Microserfs</em> or <em>Pattern Recognition</em> where you had to work to figure out which brand placements were bought and which weren't...</p>
