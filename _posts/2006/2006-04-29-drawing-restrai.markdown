<p>Oooh, looking forward to this:  <a title="SFMOMA | Exhibitions | Exhibition Overview: Matthew Barney" href="http://sfmoma.org/exhibitions/exhib_detail.asp?id=230">Matthew Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT</a>, June 23 to September 17 at the SFMOMA.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://sfmoma.org/exhibitions/exhib_detail.asp?id=230">SFMOMA is the only U.S. venue for this full-scale survey, the first to gather together Matthew Barney’s entire DRAWING RESTRAINT series. Spanning almost 20 years, DRAWING RESTRAINT  is an ongoing, performance-based project exploring the notion that form emerges through struggle against resistance. .... A site-specific installation designed by the artist, the exhibition occupies the Museum’s entire fourth floor, which has been reconfigured to eliminate the gallery walls </blockquote>

<p>Unfortunatley it looks like his talk on June 22 is already sold out...  Anyone have a spare ticket?</p>
