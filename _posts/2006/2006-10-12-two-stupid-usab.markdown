<p>Two quick software usability things I have to get off my chest.&nbsp; (I blog so I stop bothering the people who sit near me with my inane ramblings.)</p>

<ol><li>I use Windows at 1024x768, and run most of my apps fully maximized.&nbsp; It drives me absolutely batty that I can't move my mouse cursor all the way <em>to the edge of the screen</em> to grab the scrollbar in my browser, my email client, the document I'm working on.&nbsp; Instead I have to target the scrollbar by going to the edge and then <em>backing up a few pixels</em>.&nbsp; This seems very braindead -- when apps are maximized, app borders should shrink to 0 pixels to allow for appropriate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts'_law">Fitts' behavior</a>.</li>

<p><li>There must be a name for the behavior of moving your mouse pointer to the action you'll do next once the page loads.&nbsp; If there's not a name for it, someone needs to name it, and it needs to be something more clever than what I call it now, which is &quot;that thing you do with your mouse based on muscle memory while you wait for the page to load.&quot;</li></ol></p>
