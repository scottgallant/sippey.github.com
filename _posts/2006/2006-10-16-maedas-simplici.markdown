<p>Currently reading: John Maeda's <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0262134721/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/"><em>The Laws of Simplicity</em></a>. I really like the &quot;SHE&quot; mnemonic:&nbsp; shrink, hide, embody.&nbsp; &quot;Hiding complexity through ingenious mechanical doors or tiny display screens is an overt form of deception.&quot;</p>
