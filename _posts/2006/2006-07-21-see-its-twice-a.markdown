<p>There are bound to be comparisons between this fall's 30 Rock (Tina Fey's new show) and Studio 60 (the one from Aaron Sorkin), since they're both set backstage at a show that looks a lot like SNL.&nbsp; But leave it to Sorkin to <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=24&amp;entry_id=7301">beat everyone to the punch</a> at the press junket:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I'm going to take Tina's idea and add twice as many words to it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Tim Goodman's blog post is worth a clickthrough to read about Sorkin &amp; Co's self-deprecating humor re. drug abuse...</p>
