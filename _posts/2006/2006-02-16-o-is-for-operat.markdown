<p>The Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/business/media/16adco.html">dissects</a> pherotones.com, the viralbuzzmarketing campaign that promised ringtones that were supposed to attract the opposite sex...</p><blockquote><p>But rather than the revolutionary product that Pherotones promised,
the ads were the beginning of a buzz marketing campaign under the guise
of a fake product (Pherotones) and a fake doctor (Dr. Myra Vanderhood)
with a fake Web site, all for a real client with less than $250,000 to spend.&nbsp; The
real client is Oasys Mobile, a little-known cellphone content provider
that sells games, cellphone wallpaper and ring tones that can be
downloaded. </p></blockquote><p>See also the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060216/ap_on_hi_te/myspace_mobile;_ylt=Au.38UQoEtQQT5ZY.62.3YIjtBAF;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA--">MySpace MVNO</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The social networking site MySpace, hugely successful among teenagers
and twenty-somethings, is about to become more ubiquitous with the
launch of a cellular service that will let users read and post to the
site for free.</p></blockquote><p>A match made in heaven, it would seem.</p>
