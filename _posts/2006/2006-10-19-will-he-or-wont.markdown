<p>David Brooks, behind the paywall at the Times:&nbsp; <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/opinion/19brooks.html" title="Run, Barack, Run - New York Times">Run, Barack, Run</a>.&nbsp; &quot;The next Democratic nominee should either be Barack Obama or should have the stature that would come from defeating Barack Obama.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>My latest Obama experience:&nbsp; while I'm in the dentist's chair this morning with the (pseudo-relaxing) TV on to distract me from the drill, Obama's <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15327124/">on the Today show</a> with <del>Katie</del> Meredith.&nbsp; They're talking about something completely impenetrable for someone who's high on both nitrous and novocaine, but the dentist's assistant turns from the sight of me slobbering through the dam to the television and says &quot;Ohhhh, I <em>looooove</em> him!&quot; in a voice that's just this shy of a squeal.</p>
