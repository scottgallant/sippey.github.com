<p>I'm not <em>that</em> interested in downloading the 700mb dataset that is the source data for the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix Prize</a>, so here's a lazyweb request.&nbsp; I'm not smart enough to figure out a better prediction algorithm, but I am very interested in visualizing aggregate &quot;movie mood&quot; data over time from the Netflix community.&nbsp; Are people &quot;happier&quot; about the movies they rate on the weekends? What do Monday patterns look like? What about holidays -- do ratings go up from Thanksgiving to New Years?&nbsp; Are there seasonal trends?&nbsp; Does rating value correlate with major news stories?&nbsp; (See also:&nbsp; <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/MoodViews/">MoodViews</a>.)</p>
