<p>Where I grew up, Christmas season didn't start the day after Halloween, nor did it start the day after Thanksgiving. It started on December 1st - the day the Advent Calendar went up on the wall, and we could start counting down the days by peeling back a little bit of cardboard every morning.</p>

<p>Today the unstoppable Leslie Harpold kicks off <a href="http://www.harpold.com/advent/">Advent Calendar 2006</a>, where each day from now until the 25th you get &quot;a Christmas memory, a holiday link and something special.&quot;&nbsp; Mind you, this is no auto-posted template-driven affair; each day's entry is a lovingly hand-crafted and custom-designed thing of beauty. Want proof? This is the Leslie's sixth year of online Advent Calendars; after you've peeled back <a href="http://www.harpold.com/advent/01.html">today's</a>, revisit December 1sts from <a href="http://www.harpold.com/advent2005/01.html">2005</a>, <a href="http://www.harpold.com/advent2004/01.html">2004</a>, <a href="http://www.harpold.com/advent2003/01.html">2003</a>, <a href="http://www.harpold.com/advent2002/01.html">2002</a> and <a href="http://www.harpold.com/advent2001/01.html">2001</a>.<br /></p>
