<p>So you know the ads they show behind the catcher during baseball games? The ones that are composited on top of the green screen?&nbsp; I'm curious...</p>

<ul><li>Do the networks composite in different ads for different markets?</li>

<li>Even if they don't (let's say the economics are better for a national campaign), does the technology exist to do that?</li>

<li>When the game's repackaged and sold on DVD, are <em>new</em> ads composited in?</li></ul>

<p>I've heard of certain television series' using chroma key technology to enhance product placement opportunities; I'm wondering if/how this type of technology is being used (in real time or not) to deliver optimized place- or time-shifted advertising.</p>

<p>Anyone have any experience here?</p>
