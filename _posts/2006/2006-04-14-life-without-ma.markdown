<p>I'm sure absolutely <em>no one</em> will care about this, but I just need to get it out:&nbsp; I let my <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">New Yorker</a></em> subscription lapse a few months ago, and my life has been a living hell ever since.&nbsp; No Gopnik, no Hersh, no Denby, no Schjeldal (someday I'll learn how to pronounce that), no Ross, etc., etc. except for the little bits I've remembered to suck up online.&nbsp; (Is anyone out there meta-blogging their site just to produce a usable Atom feed?&nbsp; Jason, you don't count.)</p>

<p>There has been one silver lining to this dark, dark cloud -- my media diet for the past couple of months has actually included things that are an awful lot like magazines, but thicker.&nbsp; With fewer pictures.&nbsp; And no advertisements.&nbsp; But I'm feeling my attention span start to lengthen beyond a single permalink, which is just <em>killing</em> me at work.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if Amazon Prime gets you a discount on magazine shipping?&nbsp; Need to return to <em>The New Yorker</em>...and maybe pick up a <em>People</em> sub at the same time.<br /></p>
