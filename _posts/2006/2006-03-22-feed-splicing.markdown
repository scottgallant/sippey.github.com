<p>So I'm kvetching to a friend in IM how there aren't really any user-friendly <a href="http://btrott.typepad.com/typepad/2005/08/the_joy_of_spli.html">tools</a> out there for feed splicing (and how both the <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/services/api/getitems">Bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/api/Feed.aspx">Newsgator APIs</a> should break out of the feed-by-feed mode).&nbsp; How is this remix cultcha supposed to happen without things that make it easy to remix? </p>

<p>And then literally less than an hour later I find out about the new <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/03/reader-learns-to-share.html">&quot;share&quot; feature in Google Reader</a>, which will output recent items from a labeled set of feeds (or your starred items) as a styled clip for your site, or as a feed itself.&nbsp; Voila, user friendly feed splicing.</p>
