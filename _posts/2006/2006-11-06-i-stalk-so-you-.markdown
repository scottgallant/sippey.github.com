<p>Alex Ross on Steve Reich's <em>Piano Phase</em> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/music/articles/061113crmu_music">in the New Yorker</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The opening section uses only the notes E, F-sharp, B, C-sharp, and D,
which, when run together in rapid patterns, suggest the key of B minor.
Halfway in, the note A is added to the series, tilting the harmony
toward A major. This small change never fails to have a brightening,
energizing impact. Pieces like this can leave you happy for hours, like
drugs without the mess.</p></blockquote><p>And Ross has a <a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/2006/11/more_on_reich.html">great post on his blog</a> with a bunch of links to Reich related stuff (birthday and otherwise), including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuJCp9wsaj8&amp;eurl=">a YouTube'd performance of Eight Lines</a> from London.</p>
