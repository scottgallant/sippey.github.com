<p>Been enjoying the new <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> -- congrats to the team on the major interface overhaul.&nbsp; I'm not used to the new home page yet, and the folder counts are stress inducing (so many unread items!), but the core reading experience is still good, the keyboard shortcuts still respond to muscle memory, and killing the animated scroll makes the app feel more responsive.&nbsp; Kudos!</p>
