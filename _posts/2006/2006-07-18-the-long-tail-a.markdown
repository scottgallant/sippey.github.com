<p>One of the best parts of Chris Anderson's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401302378/statingtheobviou"><em>The Long Tail</em></a> is the section on the Sears Roebuck catalog and the way it changed shopping, especially for rural America.&nbsp; Couldn't find any originals for sale on eBay, but there have been plenty of reproductions published; you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0791046265/statingtheobviou">buy a repro of the 1897 catalog from Amazon</a> for a mere $13.62.&nbsp; It's worth it if you're at all a student of catalog copy; those writers knew how to <em>sell</em>.</p>
