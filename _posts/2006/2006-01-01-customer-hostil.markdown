<p>The kids are napping, the storm's approaching, and all I want to do is watch some meaningful football.&nbsp; So I sit down on the sofa, catch the last 30 seconds of the Carolina / Atlanta game, and get ready for the second half of the Fox doubleheader, which is Washington / Philadelphia, a game with playoff implications.&nbsp; Woo hoo! Red blooded American male entertainment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Which is then pre-empted by reruns of Taxi on our local affiliate, KTVU.&nbsp; Not that there's anything wrong with Taxi, mind you.&nbsp; It's just not Washington v. Philadelphia.&nbsp; Armed with my phone, I go searching online for KTVU's number to give them some red blooded American male vitriol via voice.&nbsp; But instead of their number, I end up finding <a href="http://www.ktvu.com/entertainment/5680413/detail.html">this story</a>:<br /><blockquote>Fox Sports has a scheduled its usual football double header for the first day of the year, but because of NFL rules, KTVU Fox Channel 2 will be unable to broadcast the second game.&nbsp; Because the SanFrancisco 49ers are playing at home in a game that is being aired locally, competing stations are not allowed to show other NFL games in the same time slot.<br /></blockquote>This is obviously nuts.&nbsp; I figure the rule's intended to protect the television revenue of the local franchise, but the Bay Area's two losing teams this year pretty much guaranteed that the only non-PPV NFL programming was of Really Lousy Football.&nbsp; It's doubly nuts today -- it's the last week of the season, and the 49ers aren't even fighting for the honor of the first pick in the draft.&nbsp; Playoffs start next week; the NFL should be using this week to build an audience to sustain them through Super Bowl Sunday.&nbsp; Instead, we're stuck watching a game that the local fans can't even bother to show up for -- as I watch the Niners are playing to a 1/2 empty stadium.<br /><br />It's an NFL world, and we're living in it.<br /></p>
