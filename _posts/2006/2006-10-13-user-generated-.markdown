<p>Yahoo + Jumpcut = user generated advertising.&nbsp; From Y! Search <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000365.html">blog</a>:&nbsp; &quot;We're working with Frito-Lay to invite people to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashthesuperbowl.com/">create their own Doritos commercials</a> - and the winning ad will be aired during the next Super Bowl.&quot;&nbsp; It's not entirely mob-ruled, though -- Frito-Lay and its agency will be picking the five finalists, which means that if you're going to compete it might make sense to spend some time thinking about Doritos' current brand and what they're trying to get out of this contest other than buzz.</p>
