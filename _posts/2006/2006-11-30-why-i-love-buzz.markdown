<p>So last night I was telling someone about <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>, and how much I've been enjoying it, and they took a look and then asked the obvious question:&nbsp; why?&nbsp; And all day I've been struggling to come up with the one particular reason why I'm so enamored with the site, and I can't.&nbsp; Instead, I think it's all of little things pieced together.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Like the fact that it's a highly editorialized look at bottoms up behavior.&nbsp; And, like other aggregation sites, it can then amplify what they find interesting.&nbsp; And the category mix.&nbsp; And the appreciative <em>and</em> dismissive editorial voice.&nbsp; And the judicious use of red, white and blue.&nbsp; And the big fonts!&nbsp; And the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/about">claim</a>, made with a straight face, that &quot;the moment we detect new buzz, it appears in a special terminal interface used by our editors.&quot;&nbsp; And, finally, the indeterminate yet open-ended business model possibilities that signify the bright, shiny promise of web two point oh.</p>

<p>Oh, and I'm also enjoying <a href="http://www.veryshortlist.com/">Very Short List</a>, in case you're wondering.</p>
