<p>Inspired by Kottke's <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/02/oh-what-a-year">retirement from professional bloggerdom</a>, here are some quick back of the envelope calculations on what it would take to earn Kottke-style scratch as an ad-supported blogger (instead of one supported by 1,450 micropatrons).&nbsp; You can use this as your guide to whether you should quit your job and join the New York Magazine aspirational set.</p>

<ul><li>Jason pulled in $39,900 from his campaign.&nbsp; Let's throw in an extra $100 for a <del>nice</del> decent meal out to celebrate the end of your hard-blogged year, and put up a revenue target of an even $40k.&nbsp; </li>

<li>You're a blogger, not a sales person.&nbsp; You're not hooked in with the cool kids, so <a href="http://www.coudal.com/deck/index.php">The Deck </a>ain't for you.&nbsp; Your skill set's more in line with &quot;copying and pasting JavaScript into my sidebar,&quot; so you go AdSense all the way.</li>

<li>For arguments' sake, we'll say that you're able to pull down a $1.75 effective CPM (over the course of the year you average $1.75 in revenue for every 1,000 page views).&nbsp; There is absolutely no guarantee that you'd actually be able to hit that; a<em>&nbsp;</em>healthy number for&nbsp; a community generated content site could be targeted at $1 (especially after Google's cut).&nbsp; But for argument's sake we'll say that over time your editorial integrity drives to something <em>just</em> this side of an automated blogbot, and you start targeting your content at things that people actually pay good money to advertise next to.</li></ul>

<p>OK, here comes the hard part.&nbsp; Math!&nbsp; $40,000 at $1.75 per 1,000 page views means that you'll have to do north of 22.8 million page views in the year, or 1.9 million monthly, or approximately 64,000 a day.&nbsp; Think you have it in you?</p>

<p>It doesn't take a math genius (like me!) to know that this calculation is highly influenced by the eCPM you think you could earn; if you think I'm off, post your calculation in the comments.[1]</p>
