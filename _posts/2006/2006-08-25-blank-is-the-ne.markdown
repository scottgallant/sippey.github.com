<p>I keep hearing that brown is the new black.&nbsp; And that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinkisthenewblog.com%2F&amp;ei=7z3vRKuCKI3msAK7u6m6BA&amp;sig2=0qkvRxfA4c0XKvlkN5kkig">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.pinkisthenewblog.com/">pink is the new blog</a>.&nbsp; Which led me to the question of just how many pages on the web have the phrase &quot;&lt;blank&gt; is the new &lt;blank&gt;&quot; in their title.&nbsp; Answer?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=intitle%3A*+%22is+the+new%22+*">About 100,000</a>.&nbsp; Here are the top twenty &quot;&lt;blank&gt; is the new &lt;blank&gt; results, removing the titles that don't really match the pattern...</p>

<p>The pattern &quot;&lt;blank&gt; is the new <strong>black</strong>&quot; accounts for more than half of the top twenty!&nbsp; And if you're curious, check out the Google Trend line for &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=is+the+new&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">is the new</a>&quot; -- it shows a slight trend upward in the past couple of years, and you can check out the top news stories on the term, like the Massachusetts Daily Collegian story titled &quot;<a href="http://www.dailycollegian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/04/06/4253374060ef0">Vengeance is the new Justice</a>,&quot; which somehow fittingly, 404s.<span style="color: #676767;">&nbsp;</span></p>
