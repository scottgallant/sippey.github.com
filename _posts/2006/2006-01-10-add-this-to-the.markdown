<p>Someone better add this to You Tube:&nbsp; the clip from tonight's <em>Daily Show</em> when Ed Helms managed to lure <a href="http://markcrispinmiller.blogspot.com/">Mark Crispin Miller</a> into an argument over whether Oscar the Grouch eats plastic bottles.&nbsp; There was this perfect moment when Miller snapped out of his 15-minute induced haze and realized just how foolish he must look countering Helms' argument that Oscar could in fact replace the trash collection service in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dish+texas">Dish, Texas</a>.</p>

<p>Quick, someone order me a copy of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810107929/statingtheobviou">Boxed In:&nbsp; The Culture of Television</a></em>.&nbsp; Must be a <em>fantastic</em> read.</p>
