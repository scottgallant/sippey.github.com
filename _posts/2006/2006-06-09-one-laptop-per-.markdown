<p>Ethan Zuckerman has a <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004543.html">great overview</a> of the progress the "One Laptop per Child" project is making on designing an inexpensive laptop that's perfect for kids.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004543.html"><p>Most of the people who write me are interested in owning a laptop they can afford. And that, it turns out, is not the goal of the One Laptop Per Child project. Their goal is to produce a laptop designed for use by children - students in grades K-12. And that requires radically different design decisions than what one would make in simply creating a low-cost laptop.</p></blockquote>

<p>Worth reading, especially for the description of the challenges of adding a crank for human-generated power, and how they're thinking of integrating <a href="http://www.logowiki.net/">Logowiki</a> on to the device...  (Logo == fun!  I always think of <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a> as logo for grownups.)</p>
