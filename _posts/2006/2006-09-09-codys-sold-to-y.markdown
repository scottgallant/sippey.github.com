<p>The Chronicle <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/09/BUGNTL26MA1.DTL">covers the sale of Cody's to Yohan, Inc.</a>, the Japanese book distributor.&nbsp; In it, there's a sad quote from Andy Ross about his surprise to San Francisco's reaction to the Cody's that opened in the city...</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I thought we would just open the doors (in San 
Francisco) and everyone would pour in. That was pretty stupid. Cody's was so 
well-branded in Berkeley that I took it for granted, but still there are a lot 
of people in San Francisco who don't know that the store exists.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Just like the micro-climates, there are micro-markets in the Bay Area.&nbsp; This shouldn't have been news to him...&nbsp; But at least there's a decent ending in this for Cody's, and the 4th Street store is still one of my favorite places to buy books.</p><blockquote></blockquote>
