<p>So the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">new Ipod Shuffle's a clip</a>.&nbsp; Neat!&nbsp; Here's <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/01/shuffling_light.html">something I wrote</a> back in January of last year about the original Shuffle.</p><blockquote><p>It's light enough to be remarkably light.&nbsp; Ridiculously light, even.&nbsp; So
light as to truly deserve the &quot;wearable&quot; label.&nbsp; Which is why I'm
surprised they're shipping with a lanyard instead of some sort of
integrated clip (like some other flash-based music players).&nbsp; Lanyards
would be great if headphones were wireless; otherwise you end up being
a mess of cabling.&nbsp; A clip would be perfect -- clip it to your shirt,
your pocket, your bag strap, your coat collar, your <em>tie</em> even.</p></blockquote><p>So, um, yeah.&nbsp; A clip.&nbsp; As I said...neat!</p>
