<p>If I didn't already own almost every model they carry, this news would be terribly frightening:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/cms/store.htm" title="Timbuk2 - Retail Store">Timbuk2 <del>is opening</del> has opened* a retail store</a> in Hayes Valley in San Francisco.&nbsp; Timbuk2 has done a terrific job of creating a compelling online experience (build your own bag, anyone?), so I'm interested to see how they do with retail.</p>

<p>The latest addition to my (always) growing collection of bags -- their <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/retail/catalog.htm?categoryId=63&amp;skusetId=121">Ace Day Pack</a>.&nbsp; I've always hated laptop backpacks -- they're usually way too big and way too ugly -- but this one is just right.&nbsp; Just the right size, just the right pockets and in all black you can't go wrong.&nbsp; (They're not paying me, I swear...)&nbsp; </p>

<p>Now, if only I could fill it with one of those sexy little 13&quot; MacBooks...</p>

<p>* Thanks, Owen!</p>
