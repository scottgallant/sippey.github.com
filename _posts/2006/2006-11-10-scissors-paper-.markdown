<p>I have a friend who can't stand to listen to NPR in the car; she classifies it as &quot;talk radio.&quot;&nbsp; Which means she most likely missed the best interview I'd heard in a while, Steve Inskeep's conversation this morning with <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6466928">Jason Simmons, a professional rock, paper, scissors player</a>.&nbsp; Every second is gold; highly recommended.</p>
