<p>...and <em>thank God</em> for that.&nbsp; I'm hoping that NBC either (a) deliberately <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpJPkNiP_As">leaked this to YouTube</a> or (b) has enough smarts to let this stay up there and drive interest in the new show.&nbsp; It's worth the 10 minutes out of your day...</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> it's now gone, daddy, gone.&nbsp; You'll have to wait for the real thing to see Judd Nelson do his <em>Network</em> thing so well.&nbsp; I'm hoping that even without HD you'll be able to see a vein pulse in his head...</p>
