<p>Jon Fine's <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_37/b4000039.htm">column</a> in the Sept 11 issue of Business Week is on Bree &amp; Daniel and the series of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a> videos.</p><blockquote><p>Based on comments
from media and talent agency executives, the videos appear to be
produced by a small coterie of creative types. They have had
discussions with at least one major media company. Agents are pursuing
them as well.</p></blockquote><p>So wait..they <em>appear</em> to be produced by creative types...yet they've had discussions with at least one major media company?&nbsp; Fine's being a bit cute, no?&nbsp; I agree with him, though, that this is the best bit of summer TV around.&nbsp; The &quot;who is lonelygirl15&quot; saga makes The Lost Experience seem ridiculously contrived and overblown...&nbsp; Alvar <a href="http://lostpedia.com/wiki/The_Hanso_Foundation">who</a>?</p>
