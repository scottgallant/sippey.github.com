<p>You've bought the furniture...now see the movies!&nbsp; Design Within Reach is putting on an <a href="http://www.dwr.com/eamesfilms.cfm">Eames Film Festival</a> in their stores around the country.&nbsp; Brilliant marketing move; further associate the DWR brand with Eames, and drive a slew of design geeks into the stores.&nbsp; I'm sure the one in SF will be packed, especially since there will be a presentation from one of the grandchildren.</p>

<p>I've only seen Powers of Ten (and have watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCfDRvDWid0">The Simpsons homage</a> probably two dozen times on YouTube with my daughter); would love to see the others.&nbsp; Turns out you can buy <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B0009S2K92/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/">a box set of the Eames films</a> for about $70.&nbsp; The experience of which would definitely be enhanced in the comfort of the <a href="http://www.dwr.com/productdetail.cfm?id=9100">lounge chair and ottoman set</a>.</p>

<p>(NB -- All my favorite design-y type blogs have posted about this today;
I wonder how many learned about it from DWR's nicely done (if just a
bit too frequently delivered) email newsletter?)</p>
