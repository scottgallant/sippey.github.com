<p><a href="http://www.thesinglesjukebox.com/">The Singles Jukebox</a>, &quot;Pop to two decimal places.&quot; How come I didn&#39;t know about this before?</p>

<p>I love this bit on <a href="http://www.thesinglesjukebox.com/?p=2647">Animal from Neon Trees</a>:  &quot;Hit songs based on memories of hit songs from two years ago based on memories of hit songs from five years ago based on memories of hit songs from twenty-five years ago.
