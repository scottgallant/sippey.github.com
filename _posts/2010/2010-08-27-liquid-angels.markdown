<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/08/angel-liquidity.html">Fred Wilson on angel liquidity and the Etsy deal</a>.  &quot;The interesting thing about this transaction is that it was not founder liquidity driven. The founders did not sell in the transaction. It was not VC liquidity driven. Some of the existing VC firms actually bought in the transaction. It was angel liquidity driven.&quot;</p>
