<div>Quick Friday afternoon thoughts on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/" target="_self">Mac App Store</a>.</div>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;ll buy apps through it. &#0160;And I&#39;ll bet that I&#39;ll be able to discover software through it that I otherwise wouldn&#39;t have known about, and pay for apps that I otherwise wouldn&#39;t have paid for...mostly because the checkout process will be tied to my Apple account.</li>
<li>In addition to inspiring a lot of hand-wringing posts about user control and the personal computer, I&#39;m hoping it will also inspire some innovation in software pricing and distribution models. &#0160;The app store works if you&#39;re selling downloadable apps; the Google Chrome Web Store that&#39;s coming will be a good test as to whether that works for free / ad-supported apps, or subscription-based apps. </li>
<li>If you look at the app store trend from a 30,000 foot view, there&#39;s clearly a hole in the market around software discovery, installation and management that&#39;s starting to be filled by these app stores. Is this a failure of the web? Of the googlebot?</li>
<li>If over time the PC experience becomes more like CE, where the experience is tightly controlled, are developers more or less likely to shift work away from client software to browser-delivered services? &#0160;Local or cloud? &#0160;Objective C or Python + JavaScript + HTML5?</li>
<li>The pain point around safe and reliable software discovery, installation and management is much higher if you&#39;re in the Microsoft ecosystem than if you&#39;re a Mac user. How long until the Windows app store arrives?</li>
<li>Posit for a minute that there are three major modes of information / app discovery: &#0160;curation (I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s good and put it on a list), search (you know what you&#39;re looking for and I&#39;ll help you find it) and social (discover what your friends are using). Curation requires taste, and that&#39;s where Apple&#39;s brand strength lies. &#0160;Search requires breadth, and breadth means that you need to let in more than you could ever really understand. &#0160;And social requires, well, an integrated graph.</li>
<li>Microsoft&#39;s investment in Facebook is looking smarter every day.&#0160;</li>
</ol>
<p>Fun times ahead.</p>
