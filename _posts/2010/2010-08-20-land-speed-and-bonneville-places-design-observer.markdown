<p><a href="http://places.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=14798">Martin Hogue at Design Observer on the Bonneville salt flats</a>.  &quot;I would argue that in this sense racing became a sort of idealization of the site and its resources, and that consequently the activities of racing and the events of record setting are in fact entirely connected to a greater sense of the landscape in both space and time. It was in recognizing the potential of the Bonneville flats as a natural surface to race on that a mutually beneficial relationship among technology and ambition and the landscape was forged â€” and with it a deep respect for the land.&quot;</p>
