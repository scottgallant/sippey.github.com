<p>Dave Pell laments his slip from dealer to user, and confesses his addiction to the streaming realtime app-enabled social media hoo ha, since he&#39;s doing things like checking his iPhone every five minutes and avoiding his children and tweeting while driving, etc., etc.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have this problem.  Sure, I&#39;m as addicted to the streaming realtime app-enabled social media hoo ha.  But I don&#39;t have the guilt of slipping from a dealer to a user.  I&#39;ve always been a user...so now being a dealer as well and having access to my own supply now only makes things easier.</p>
