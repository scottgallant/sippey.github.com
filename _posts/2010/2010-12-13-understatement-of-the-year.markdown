<p>From MLBTradeRumors <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2010/12/agree-to-sign-cliff-lee.html">coverage of Cliff Lee</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phillies fans are surely thrilled to have Lee back in Philadelphia, but the MLB Players Association won&#39;t necessarily like his decision to leave so much money on the table instead of setting a precedent for other pitchers. However, this offseason has seen two free agents (Werth and Crawford) sign nine-figure contracts, <strong>so players are doing well in general</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
