<blockquote><p>It occurs to me I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen someone fail to understand figurative language because of a basic inability. Rather, geeks use it as a dodge: if you can&#39;t quickly respond to what someone&#39;s really saying, it remains easy to put the words together literally and answer that. You might get a laugh, and you can&#39;t be accused of being wrong!</p>

<p>The post is great -- it&#39;s short, so go read the whole thing. I&#39;m guilty of this occasionally, but it&#39;s a habit I&#39;m trying to cure myself of.  It&#39;s the verbal equivalent of fisking (which I hate), and is damaging to real conversation and communication.</p>
