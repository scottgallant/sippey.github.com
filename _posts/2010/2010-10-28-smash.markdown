<p>This one minute 51 second YouTube video of a bunch of people <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbNKVmWj1K4&amp;feature=player_embedded#!" target="_self">dropping a 1,169 pound pumpkin on a car</a> is pretty much what it sounds like. If you&#39;re impatient and just want to see a huge pumpkin smash in the hood of an already busted up car, you can skip the first 40 seconds, and the last 60 seconds.&#0160;</p>
