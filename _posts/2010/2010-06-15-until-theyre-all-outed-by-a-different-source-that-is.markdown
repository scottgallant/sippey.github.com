<blockquote><p>&quot;The Big 12 sticking wasn&#39;t a miracle,&#39;&#39; said the source. &quot;There have been a number of people who were involved -- a number of seriously key people -- unrelated to the conference who will never be known to have helped get things on track.&#39;&#39;</p></blockquote>

<p>Somehow I think the identity of those &quot;seriously key people&quot; who worked to keep the NCAA&#39;s Big 12 in one piece won&#39;t quite have the same level of secrecy attached to them as, say, Deep Throat.</p>
