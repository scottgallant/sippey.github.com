<blockquote><p>In the end, the success of a show like 2-D/3-D, beyond the magic that the artists themselves create, has much to do with Katrina Traywick herself, who dares to transform her space into a living and shifting laboratory of sorts. In doing so, she inspires each of us to consider bringing something fresh and unconventional into our own homes, or, at the very least, to move our pictures around from time to time.</p></blockquote>
