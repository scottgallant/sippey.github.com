<blockquote><p>This is how the NBA&#39;s situation differs from Hollywood three years ago. Hollywood stumbled by accident into the realization that things were broken. But the NBA already knows. The league wants a system more beneficial to owners that features a hard salary cap, no long-term deals (only three or four years guaranteed at most) and no luxury tax. The players will dig their feet in and fight. We will have a lockout or a strike. It will last for months. And months. And months. Start preparing yourself mentally now. It&#39;s going to happen.</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>Bill Simmons (yes, David, I know, I still need to read The Book) dumps 3,800 words on just how completely screwed up the NBA is.  I don&#39;t follow the sport that closely, but even the casual observer has to wonder just how the hell the league (as a system) can afford to do things like paying Jamaal Tinsley &quot;$10.6 million this season and the next by Indiana *not* to play there.&quot;  Worth reading in full.</p>
