<p>Scott Berkun blogs about the <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2010/lessons-from-wave-and-kin/">lessons from Google Wave and MSFT Kin</a>. The snark in me loved his line about Wave -- &quot;As a rule, any software in this century that reinvents the scroll bar deserves to fail&quot; -- but it&#39;s depressing to think that the Kin team won&#39;t even get a postmortem. As Scott writes, &quot;the lessons of Kin will likely die with Kin.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, a belated congratulations to Scott on joining Automattic -- they&#39;re lucky to have him and I look forward to seeing the impact he has on Wordpress.com and the company as a whole.  Good stuff!</p>
