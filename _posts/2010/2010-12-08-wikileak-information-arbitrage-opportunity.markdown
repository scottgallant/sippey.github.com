<p>This bit from a former intelligence analyst on a mailing list I&#39;m on caught my attention...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s a wonderful opportunity for market &amp; other manipulation through forged Wikileak cables, i.e., if only a tiny smattering of them have been published as yet, and when they are they&#39;re often DDoS&#39;ed into obscurity but potentially downloaded by some and forwarded around, then if some particularly juicy cable turned up, it&#39;s likely to be believed, for long enough, by a certain set of people.</p>
<p>So, say, a cable about apparent Russian mafia plans to corner a particular commodity... &quot;leak&quot; it to all the right people, after putting a bunch of calls on the commodity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In further email conversation he pointed out that (a) the Intelligence Community wouldn&#39;t want to confirm or deny the veracity of any forged cables, and (b) Assange, being in jail, wouldn&#39;t be in any position to comment on them either... <strong>Now&#39;s the time, people.</strong></p>
