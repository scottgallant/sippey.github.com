<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129235528">Writer Joshua Braff confesses his guilty pleasures</a>.  &quot;For all I achieve in fiction, I thank John Irving and Stephen King. These authors are maestros of craft. Their characters live and breathe before, during and after the story ends.&quot; Amen.</p>
