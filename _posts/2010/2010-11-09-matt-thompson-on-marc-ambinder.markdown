<blockquote><p>Perhaps more than any other publishing/broadcasting format, a blog is a manifestation of the choices and idiosyncrasies of its authors.</p></blockquote>

<p>Matt Thompson&#39;s long-ish <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/6375">Snarkmarket piece</a> on Marc Ambinder&#39;s blogend at The Atlantic is well worth reading. I love the fact that a dozen or so years on we&#39;re still having the discussion about &quot;what is a blog;&quot; because if we&#39;re still having it it means that the medium is vibrant, constantly changing, and fluid enough to encompass a wide variety of voices and forms.</p>
