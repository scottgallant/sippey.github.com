<p>John Borthwick has a good post <a href="http://www.borthwick.com/weblog/2010/08/13/tweetdeck-multistream-unistream-getting-it-all-streamed-right/" target="_self">dissecting the new Android version of Tweetdeck</a>, which, from all appearances (I&#39;m not an Android user) does something interesting in combining streams from mutiple services and differentiating the updates in a useful way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The&#0160;original&#0160;Tweetdeck broke new ground in how Twitter could be used. &#0160; All the Twitter clients had until that time taken their DNA from the IM clients. &#0160; They all sought to replicate a single column, a diminutive view of the stream. &#0160; Tweetdeck on the desktop changed all of that. &#0160; Offering a multi column view that was immersive, intense and full on. &#0160; &#0160; As you move your service to different platforms (say from Web to mobile) you are faced with the perplexing question of whether you re-think the service to fit the dimensions and features of the new platform (mobile) or you offer users the same&#0160;familiar&#0160;experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a pretty bold move for the Tweetdeck team, whose product brand is pretty much defined by the &quot;I&#39;m a power user, hear me roar from the cockpit of my social media supersonic jet fighter&quot; multi-column layout. Would love to see this in their iPhone version.</p>
