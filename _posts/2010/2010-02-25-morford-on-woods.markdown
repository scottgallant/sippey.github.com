<blockquote><p>Tiger wasn&#39;t apologizing to actual people, to his wife or kids or even his confused fans. Tiger was apologizing, straight up and to the bone, to <i>capitalism itself</i>. To his own brand. It was a scary attempt to shore up the multimillions in endorsement deals, his future as a billion-dollar icon. Tiger the man was apologizing to Tiger, Inc., mostly for tainting its earnings potential.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mark Morfold takes apart&#39;s Tiger&#39;s public apology in only the way Morford can.  That graf right there?  Probably the tamest thing in the whole piece.</p>
