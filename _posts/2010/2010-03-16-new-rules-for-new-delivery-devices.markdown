<blockquote><p>There&#39;s an old adage in photography: the best camera is the one you have with you. Now that our media is available in so many formats, we can say that the best book is the one on your Kindle or the best movie is the one on your iPhone.</p></blockquote>

<p>I liked this nugget in Jason&#39;s post about how online reviewers of books and movies are now delivering negative reviews based on their packaging and delivery.</p>
