<p>My favorite post on the web right now is at Serious Eats:  <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/03/do-you-have-a-hard-time-eating-animal-shaped-foods.html">Do You Have a Hard Time Eating Animal-Shaped Foods?</a>  The comment thread is just getting started:  &quot;Yes, eating a large chocolate bunny is difficult. No moral qualms, just melting point problems.&quot;</p>
