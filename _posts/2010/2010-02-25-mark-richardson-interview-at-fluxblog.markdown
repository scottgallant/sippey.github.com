<p>Fluxblog&#39;s Matthew Perpetua posts a <a href="http://www.fluxblog.org/2010/02/fluxblog-interview-with-mark-richardson">long, in-depth discussion</a> with Pitchfork&#39;s Mark Richardson about The Flaming Lips.  (Richardson&#39;s written a book about their record <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0826429017">Zaireeka</a>.)  I loved this sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am drawn to experiences that take some work to make happen, because, since they require work, they will inevitably not happen as frequently.</p></blockquote>
