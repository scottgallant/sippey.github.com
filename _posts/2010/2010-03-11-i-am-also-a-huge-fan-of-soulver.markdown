<blockquote><p>DVD players donâ€™t make fake whirring noises for five minutes before letting you eject a disc to simulate rewinding. Similarly, nobody should need to perform a full-width swipe gesture and wait two seconds for their fake page to turn in their fake book, and nobody should need to click the fake Clear button and start their calculation over because their fake calculator only has a one-line, non-editable fake LCD.</p></blockquote>

<p>I no longer click the fake clear button to clear the display on my one-line, non-editable fake LCD.  I am a convert to <a href="http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/">Soulver</a> (desktop and iPhone) and it really is a thing of beauty.</p>
