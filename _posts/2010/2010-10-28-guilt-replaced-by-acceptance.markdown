<p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/28/myAiryBook.html" target="_self">Dave Winer nails the whole new product from Apple thing, combined with the Amazon one click ordering thing</a>. &#0160;&quot;You know you&#39;re going to give in&#0160;<em>at some point</em>&#0160;and click the button. If you click it right now you can enjoy the product tomorrow! Turns out that&#39;s just the right amount of instant gratification. Not so much that I have to feel the guilt now, that gets postponed a few hours. And by the time it arrives, the guilt has been replaced by acceptance.&quot;</p>
