<p>io9 has a multi-hundred word screencap-illustrated post (tl;dr) on <a href="http://io9.com/5673855/why-doc-brown-is-the-real-villain-of-back-to-the-future">Why Doc Brown is the real villain of Back to the Future</a> with the perfect lede:</p>

<blockquote><p>The real monster in the Back To The Future movies isn&#39;t the bully Biff, argues Premiere&#39;s Gene Newman. It&#39;s Doc Brown, the lying manipulator who deals with terrorists and nearly destroys the space-time continuum. <strong>Spoilers ahead.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
