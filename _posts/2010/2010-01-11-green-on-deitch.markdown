<p>Tyler Green at Modern Art Notes on <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2010/01/some_responses_to_mocas_new_di.html">MOCA hiring Jeffrey Deitch</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In a <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2010/01/weekend_roundup_132.html">haven&#39;t-I-read-that-before</a> piece on New York magazine&#39;s <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/01/los_angeles_moca_set_to_name_j.html">website</a>, Jerry Saltz pulls out this cliche: &quot;[B]ear in mind that MOCA desperately needs to think outside the box...&quot; Actually, no it doesn&#39;t. It was thinking &quot;outside the box&quot; (namely: profligate spending) that got MOCA into trouble in the first place. <strong>MOCA needs to continue to do what it&#39;s done well for most of the last 30 years: collecting contemporary art and launching smart, historical, revisionist exhibitions and programs that define the period.</strong> </p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine. I&#39;ve written about both of them here before, but MOCA put on two shows in the early 90s that really formed the way I look at contemporary art today, and how museums put on shows:  <a href="http://www.moca.org/library/archive/exhibition/detail/3374">Helter Skelter: LA Art in the 1990s</a> and <a href="http://www.moca.org/library/archive/exhibition/detail/2830">Rolywholyover A Circus</a>. More like those, pls.</p>
