<p>Barnes and Noble Review <a href="http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Interview/Don-DeLillo/ba-p/2144">interviews Don Delillo</a> re. <em>Point Omega</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I donâ€™t write essaylike fiction.  My work tends to have a strong visual quality -- the idea is to make the reader see, and it may be the case that my interest in film has helped fashion this tendency.  In the case of the videowork what I experienced was not only film, it was also time; it was also mind.  With motion slowed so radically, one experiences another way to see, another way to think.  Things seem intensely what they are, broken down into atoms, into motes of light, as if seen for the first time. </p>

<p>My copy arrived today. Blogging this now to remember to return to it later after reading the book.</p>
