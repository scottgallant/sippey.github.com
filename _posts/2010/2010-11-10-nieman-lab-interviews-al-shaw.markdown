<blockquote><p>It’s really good that a lot of sites are starting to experiment more with data-driven journalism, especially as web frameworks and cheap cloud hosting become more prevalent and you can learn Rails and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, it’s really easy to get a site up that’s based around data you can collect. I do see two kind of disturbing trends that are also happening. One is the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/02/infographics-all-the-way-down/">rise of infographics</a>. They may not be as useful as they are pretty. You see that a lot just all over the place now. The other problem you see is the complete opposite of that where you’ll get just a table of data filling up your whole screen. The solution is somewhere in between that. You have a better way of getting into it.</p></blockquote>
