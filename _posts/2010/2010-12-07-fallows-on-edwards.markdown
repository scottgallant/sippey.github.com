<p>James Fallows on being <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/12/elizabeth-edwards/67668/">at an event with Elizabeth Edwards</a> with a bunch of &quot;heavy hitters&quot; during the 2004 presidential campaign...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The longer the evening went on, the more people kept deferring and asking questions of, Elizabeth Edwards. By the end, it was like a seminar that she was conducting for the rest. She was talking mainly not about her husband&#39;s campaign but about her assessment of the larger shape of the presidential race. ... There was nothing &quot;brave&quot; or tragic about it, just someone who was intelligent, clear-eyed, and tough. I would like to remember that accomplished side of her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May she rest in the peace she deserves.</p>
