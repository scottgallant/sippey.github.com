<p>Over the weekend I discovered <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/4572325944/">Popular Highlights</a> magically appearing in the book I was reading on my "Kindle."[1]  As <a href="http://kottke.org/10/05/popular-kindle-passages">widely reported</a>, Amazon is collating the highlighting activity of its readers, and making that activity visible to readers on the Kindle...<a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/popular_highlights">and on the web</a>.  So now you can satisfy that previously impossible-to-satisfy desire to know the most popular highlighted passage in <a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/work/the-lost-symbol-ebook/B00279HLIQ">Dan Brown's Lost Symbol</a>, or <a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/work/last-lecture-the-ebook/B00128QM4M">Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture</a>, or <a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/work/unnamed-joshua-ferris/B00252OMCS">Joshua Ferris' The Unnamed</a>.</p>

<p>Or this one from <a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/work/white-noise-classics-deluxe-penguin/B000B13IXY">Don DeLillo's White Noise</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the whole point of technology. It creates an appetite for immortality on the one hand. It threatens universal extinction on the other. Technology is lust removed from nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Welcome to the future.</p>

<p><small>[1] Where "Kindle" = Kindle app on the iPhone and iPad, the combination of which is absolutely unstoppable.  Anyone interested in a first gen Kindle Kindle? Make me an offer.</small></p>
