<p>If something was wrong with Friendster, you could have just told it so. Whatever your issue was, it would have been a hundred times better to let Friendster know what was wrong than to just disappear and leave Friendster to sit alone for six years, desperately cobbling together a “Fun” section to win you back.</p>

<p>Mike Lacher&#39;s email from a personified Friendster (&quot;We&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve logged into Friendster!&quot;) is fantastic.  Please, won&#39;t someone write the accompanying IM conversation with a personified Facebook where Mike dishes on the pathetic email he just got from Friendster, and Facebook piles on in an overly aggressive way? Thanks in advance.</p>
