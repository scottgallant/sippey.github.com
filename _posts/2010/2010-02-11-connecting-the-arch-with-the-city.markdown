<p>Tyler Green <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2010/02/putting_the_arch_back_in_st_lo.html">covers the project</a> that will finally connect the Gateway Arch more directly to downtown St. Louis.</p>

<blockquote><p>The National Park Service and the city of St. Louis have sponsored a competition -- which seems to be called <a href="http://www.cityarchrivercompetition.org/">Framing a Modern Masterpiece,</a> but which should be nicknamed something less metaphor-abusing -- to encourage architects to come up with plans to link downtown with the Arch with the Mississippi River. Yesterday the competition announced its nine finalists. The Architect&#39;s Newspaper <a href="http://archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=4234">has the list</a>, as does the competition itself, <a href="http://www.cityarchrivercompetition.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Nine-Teams-Reach-Second-Round-of-Gateway-Arch-Design-Competition-2-10-2010.pdf">via PDF.</a> (The list of <a href="http://www.cityarchrivercompetition.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Competition-Registration.pdf">firms that entered</a> is pretty impressive too. Saarinen&#39;s successor-firm, Roche-Dinkeloo, did not make the cut to nine.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I grew up in St. Louis, so for me the Arch is myth-level sculpture; I blogged about <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2009/07/the-arch.html">the relationship between the Arch and the new Busch Stadium</a> last summer.</p>
