<p>If you&#39;re a Cubs fan...or just a fan of Wrigley Field, you&#39;ll appreciate this:  Everyblock&#39;s Daniel X. O&#39;Neil went <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/2010/03/wrigley-field-work-new-banners-out-front-refreshed-scoreboard-new-billboard-in-left-field-batting-ca.html">digging through the city permits</a> for all the work that&#39;s happening on the stadium in prep for baseball season.  On deck: new promotional signage on the outside of the stadium, some scoreboard repairs, a new sign in left field, an improved batting cage, an improved umpire dressing room and more capacity in the women&#39;s restrooms.</p>
