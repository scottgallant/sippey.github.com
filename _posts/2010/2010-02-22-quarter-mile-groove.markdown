<p>Today and Tomorrow points to <a href="http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/2010/02/22/quarter-mile-groove/">Quarter Mile Groove</a>, a conceptual art piece by Daniel Eatock.</p>

<blockquote><p>The recording translates the length of its vinyl groove into audio allowing listeners to experience the 1/4 mile length of the spiral as the record is played.</p></blockquote>

<p>I like that Eatock included the vinyl residue of the initial master cutting of the record as part of the piece.  When unraveled it would (obviously) be a quarter-mile long.</p>
