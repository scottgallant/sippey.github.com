<blockquote><p>I remember fondly that time when an RA turned on the lights and yelled “WHO OWNS THESE PANTS?” Except this time, the pants are a company, and the RA is you, and the sixty five hours of community service is a deal that will ensure the Woot.com experience can continue to grow for years and years and years, like a black mold behind the Gold Box.</p></blockquote>

<p>I could blog Every. Single. Paragraph. from the Woot CEO&#39;s letter to employees re the Amazon acquisition, and it still wouldn&#39;t be enough.  Go read it, and just <i>try</i> to imagine writing an email to your team that&#39;s 10% as good as this one.</p>
