<p>As I discovered this weekend, Curling is a fantastic sport to watch while operating at less than full capacity.  And now, there&#39;s a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1557945/infographic-of-the-day-curling-explained">fantastic infographic</a> that explains the sport to newbies. I really could have used this on Sunday morning.</p>

<p><small>(Via <a href="http://www.good.is/post/how-curling-works">Good</a>, who describes Curling as &quot;shuffleboard with real-time friction management.&quot;)</small></p>
