<blockquote><p>Moore and Bening are superb actors here, evoking a marriage of more than 20 years, and all of its shadings and secrets, idealism and compromise. Nic is more of the mind, Jules is more of the heart. The film gives them convincing, intelligent dialogue, mannerisms that fit and children who, having been raised outside homophobic hysteria, are nice and well-adjusted.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ebert reviews <i>The Kids Are All Right</i>, and I&#39;m kind of shocked that a movie with convincing, intelligent dialog and children that are nice and well-adjusted actually got the green light.  Two thumbs up.</p>
