<p>I&#39;ve come to really appreciate hyperlocal blogging...mostly because in the past year or so <a href="http://www.berkeleyside.com/">Berkeleyside</a> has grown into a tremendous news outlet for my adopted home town. I&#39;m hyperlocally self-centered that way.</p>
<p>Case in point:  Tracey Taylor&#39;s <a href="http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/11/10/solano-community-wants/">in-depth post</a> about the survey our local councilmember did to find out what people who live near Solano Avenue (like me!) want out of their local business district. (More restaurants! That are open later! Fewer ridiculous city planning restrictions!)</p>
<p>Good stuff.  I hope you&#39;re lucky enough to have a blog like Berkeleyside that covers your home town.</p>
