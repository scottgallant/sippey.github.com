<p>File under: this type of coverage makes me seriously doubt what I'm reading about topics I know less about.  CNN covers the "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/15/app.store/index.html">major new app store</a>" that the wireless carriers are cooking up.  And the story's written as if this will finally allow consumers to get apps for their iPhones from someone besides Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The groups said their site will give app developers a simple route to publishing and marketing, and will offer smartphone customers new apps quicker and a wider selection than anyone else. ... Until now, Apple has had control over all apps that run on its iPhones, offering them only through the company's official online store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally unbelievable.</p>

<p>Off to read some CNN.com coverage of health care, the financial markets and the war in Afghanistan!</p>
