<p>At the risk of turning this into a Ken Norton reblog, via a comment from him on yesterday&#39;s <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/12/groupon-is-copywriting-performance-art.html">Groupon copywriting post</a> comes the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/View?id=dmv9rbh_2g92x4scj&amp;pli=1&amp;ndplr=1">Public Groupon Voice Guide</a>, &quot;intended to help new and applying writers lean Groupon&#39;s signature writing style.&quot;</p>
<p>The voice guide includes instructions to use all the things you&#39;re taught to avoid as a young writer...</p>
<ul>
<li>Absurd images. Sweeping, dramatic nonsense. The absurd narrator.</li>
<li>Hypothetical worlds / outcomes</li>
<li>Fake proverbs, adages</li>
<li>Mixed metaphors</li>
<li>Fake history</li>
<li>Negative comparisons: “…unlike when…”</li>
<li>Highly technical language (medical, scientific, etc.). Use when it’s least called for to overcomplicate things.</li>
<li>Illogical comparisons and lists</li>
</ul>
<p>So good.</p>
