<p>Jim Ray on <a href="http://jimray.tumblr.com/post/340784544/cover-it-on-twitter-says-newspaper-editors-daughter">newspapers adopting Twitter and Facebook</a> for real time reporting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of the day news operations are being rebuilt around a company or two that seem largely disinterested in those very operations. To put it another way, imagine if there were only one network for email and one, albeit pretty cool, company controlled that. Would we be so excited about newspapers jumping on that trend?</p>

  <p>I’d love to believe that this is a shining example of news orgs finally abandoning the very annoying “not invented here” habits that have hampered them for so long but they seem to be doing it by chasing a trend without much thought.</p>
