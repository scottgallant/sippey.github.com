<blockquote><p>Indeed, Povenmire and Jeff Marsh incorporate sophisticated one-liners that would once provoke winces from network executives, like the one about Existentialist Wacky Pack trading cards, in which one character remarks to the other, &quot;I&#39;ll trade you two Nietzsche for a Sartre.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They&#39;d say, &#39;Is that joke too old for our audience?&#39; &quot; Povenmire said. &quot;And we&#39;d say, &#39;We don&#39;t care as long as that joke doesn&#39;t make the kids change the channel. There&#39;s a joke coming for them in five seconds. We&#39;re playing to the adults in the room.&#39; &quot;</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>The LA Times reports that &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; is about to have the full Disney marketing machine behind it, with more episodes, a full line of merchandise and maybe even a movie.</p>

<p>Two thumbs up from the Sippey household -- we (all of us) love the show; it&#39;s fantastic.  If you haven&#39;t watched it yet, you should.  Because if Disney has anything to do with it, you <em>will</em> be watching it soon, so you might as well get a head start.</p>
