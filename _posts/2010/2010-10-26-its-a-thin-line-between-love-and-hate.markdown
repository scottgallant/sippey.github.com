<p>Finding this story from NPR about our <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130356647">irrational relationships with dentists</a> is great timing (thanks, <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt</a>, for sharing it!), since I spent two hours in the chair yesterday being poked and scraped and drilled and generally unhappy and sweating nervously while biting down on that black rubber mouth guard.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dentistry is basically [an] unpleasant experience. They poke in your mouth. It&#39;s uncomfortable. It&#39;s painful. It&#39;s unpleasant. You have to keep your mouth open. And I think all of this pain actually causes cognitive dissonance - and cause higher loyalty to your dentist. Because who wants to go through this pain and say, I&#39;m not sure if I did it for the right reason. I&#39;m not sure this is the right guy.</p></blockquote>

<p>I highly recommend Jill Martenson at <a href="http://www.piedmontdentalbydesign.com/">Piedmont Dental by Design</a> in Oakland.</p>
