<p>Nelson Minar details <a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/aviation/why-is-flying-hard.html">why flying a plane is hard</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Planes at altitude have a lot of potential energy. A primary challenge of landing a plane is learning how to bleed that energy off to make a soft landing. In a car you just brake. And if something goes wrong in your car you can pull over to the shoulder and stop; that doesn&#39;t work so well in a plane.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read it all the way through and tell me your brain doesn&#39;t hurt just thinking about it.</p>
