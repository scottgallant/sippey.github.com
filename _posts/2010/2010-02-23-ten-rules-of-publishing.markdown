<p>From Jeffrey L. Smith&#39;s Amazon review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elmore-Leonards-10-Rules-Writing/dp/0061451487/ref=sr_1_1">Elmore Leonard&#39;s Ten Rules of Writing</a>.

</p><blockquote><p>What we have here is an 85-page hardback book that has the contents of a 4-page article from the New York Times. How is this possible? You can use cardstock instead of paper, to make the book 3/4&quot; thick. Then you put one paragraph on a page. And on other pages, you put one sentence. Make 85% of the book white space, and make the book pretty small. Add some pen and ink drawings on some pages. Pretty soon, this hardback book is starting to look like a hardback book. You can&#39;t bend the pages (remember that they are made of cardstock). How long does it take to read this hardback book? A little bit longer than reading an essay in the NY Times. The pages are easier to turn in the NY Times.</p>

<p>It is interesting that the Tag Suggestions provided by Amazon.com include the terms &quot;ripoff&quot; and &quot;rip off&quot;. I&#39;ll choose &quot;rip off&quot; as it takes up more space and will make this review seem much more like the length of a hardback book.
