<blockquote><p>And people aren&#39;t <em>looking</em> for a replacement for email, or instant messaging, or blogs, or wikis. Those tools all work great for their intended purposes, and whatever technology augments them will likely offer a different combination of persistence and immediacy than those systems. Right now, Wave evokes all of them without being its own distinctive thing. Which means it&#39;s most useful in providing reference implementations of particular new features.</p>

<p>Never mind the &quot;Pushbutton platform&quot; stuff that comes in the paragraph after, it&#39;s this paragraph that matters. No one was looking for Wave.</p>

<p>Regardless, kudos to Google for killing it so quickly. No matter how obvious it is that it needs to happen, killing children is never easy. </p>
