<blockquote><p>I don’t think we capture the right moments. The camera flashes and we pose. We <em>pose</em>. We create moments as artificial as the memory we want of them. We stare into lenses and lie, if only a little, so that the record shows we were there, enjoying or not enjoying ourselves, in precisely the way we’d prefer it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think one of the major technology-enabled trends of the past 10 years has been the massive decrease in elapsed time between when a photo is taken and when it is shared...not to mention the correlative reduction in the marginal cost of sharing an individual photo. </p>

<p>Like Jack, I&#39;ve never been a fan of the posed photo. But as the posed photo gives way to the stream of captured moments, maybe those images will lie less often.</p>
