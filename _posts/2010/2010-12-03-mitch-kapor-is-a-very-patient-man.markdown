<p>One of the great ongoing Berkeley sagas that <a href="http://www.berkeleyside.com/">Berkeleyside</a> has been covering (well!) is Mitch Kapor&#39;s desire to build a home in North Berkeley, on a very odd lot that honestly would benefit from having a new home on it.  But he&#39;s been having a hell of a time with it, thanks to the &quot;Not In My Backyard&quot; attitude of my fellow Berkeley citizens...except this time, the NIMBY&#39;s <a href="http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/12/03/mitch-kapor/">don&#39;t actually live in Kapor&#39;s back yard</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An unusual factor in the case is that immediate neighbors to the proposed home have&#0160;<a href="http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/03/15/neighbors-express-support-for-2707-rose-street-home/">publicly expressed their support</a> for the Kapors’ plan. In his opposition brief to the court, Mr&#0160; Kulkari cited City Councilmember Linda Maio who remarked at the April Council appeal meeting that in her 20 years as a member of the Zoning Adjustment Board and City Council, this was the first time all immediate neighbors supported a project while other residents, who did not reside in the immediate vicinity, objected. Mr Kulkari compared the BHP group to “armchair planners” who were “raising their&#0160;subjective objections from a comfortable distance away from the project location”.</p>

<p>Berkeley is fractal. Our city council isn&#39;t afraid to play <a href="http://www.eastbayexpress.com/92510/archives/2010/01/27/could-berkeleys-foreign-policy-help-detained-hikers-in-iran">armchair foreign policy</a>...so our citizens aren&#39;t afraid to play armchair city planners.  See also Michael Chabon&#39;s <a href="http://are.berkeley.edu/~howardr/berkeley.html">ode to Berkeley</a>: &quot;Nowhere else is the individual encumbered with a greater burden of shame and communal disapproval for having intruded, however innocently, on the sensibilities of another.&quot;</p>
