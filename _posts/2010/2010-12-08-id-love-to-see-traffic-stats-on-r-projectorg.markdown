<p>Tim Berners-Lee on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/nov/22/data-analysis-tim-berners-lee">future of journalism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Journalists need to be data-savvy. It used to be that you would get stories by chatting to people in bars, and it still might be that you&#39;ll do it that way some times. But now it&#39;s also going to be about poring over data and equipping yourself with the tools to analyse it and picking out what&#39;s interesting. And keeping it in perspective, helping people out by really seeing where it all fits together, and what&#39;s going on in the country.&quot;</p>
