<p><a href="http://thebhj.com/journal/2010/8/14/after-the-explosion.html">B. Hockey J.</a>: &quot;After the explosion itâ€™s quiet for awhile. More quiet than that. Everything holds its breath. The furniture. The books on their shelves. The photographs hanging on the walls. None of them move. Well. I suppose they never move, but now they move less. Everything holds its breath.&quot;</p>
