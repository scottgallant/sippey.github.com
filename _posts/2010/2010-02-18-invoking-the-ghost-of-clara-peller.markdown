<p>Over at <a href="http://www.geekweek.com/">GeekWeek</a>, Luke Thompson&#39;s been reviewing various fast food items. Up this week, the <a href="http://www.geekweek.com/2010/02/fast-food-review-wendys-premium-fish-fillet.html">Wendy&#39;s Premium Fish Fillet</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lighter, these are not. The piece of
fish on my sandwich was dwarfed by the bun (Hey Wendy’s, I think I hear the ghost of Clara Peller: “Where’s the fish?”), and the fish itself was dominated by the, ahem, “Panko.” Wendy’s dense buns are good for burgers loaded with
drippy toppings – if they were to bring back some kind of chili cheeseburger,
I’d advocate them – but when you’re dealing with an already-breaded product,
it’s a bit much. The fish was also a bit too salty for my tastes, though I tend
to like less salt than most, but a hint of slight spiciness was welcome. Beyond
that, they add lettuce, sauce, and – for forty more cents! – cheese.</p></blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t an ironic foodie review (&quot;Oh, look how hip we are appreciating the fast food&quot;), this is from a true fast-food lover. Who else would know so much about Wendy&#39;s dense buns?</p>
