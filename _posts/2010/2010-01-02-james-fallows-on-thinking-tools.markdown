<p>James Fallows is a fantastic blogger, and has a history of doing great reviews of software &quot;thinking tools&quot; like outliners and Ecco and The Brain, etc.  He&#39;s back on the thinking tools warpath <a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/more_on_grandview_thinklinkr_a.php">these past few days</a>; pointing folks to <a href="http://thinklinkr.com/">Thinklinkr</a> (a web-based collaborative outliner) and digging up some screenshots of GrandView, the DOS product that &quot;many buffs consider...the best outliner ever invented.</p>

<p>Call it a new year&#39;s fetish, but I&#39;m trying to get back into thinking tools.  And it&#39;s depressing, because leaving aside the slew of <a href="http://al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html">everything buckets</a> out there (all falling into the two- or three-paned note taking metaphor), there really hasn&#39;t been much advancement in tools that help you capture, organize and interlink random bits of data since, well, <a href="http://www.thebrain.com/">The Brain</a>.  Or am I missing something?</p>
