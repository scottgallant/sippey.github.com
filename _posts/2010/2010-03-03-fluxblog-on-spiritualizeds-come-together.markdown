<blockquote><p>On other tracks from <em>Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating In Space</em>, the waves of sound are comforting and numbing, but in this, it pounds down on you, like he’s trying to beat some sense into himself. It’s futile, though — as the song tapers off and bleeds into the woozy opening section of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Za161pBwBA">“I Think I’m In Love,”</a> it’s like slipping back into a stupor.</p></blockquote>

<p>+1.  (Also, I saw Spiritualized open up for Radiohead on the OK Computer tour, and they were fantastic. When they did &quot;Come Together&quot; the otherwise too-cool-for-school shoe-gazing Yorke-worshipping crowd looked up and took notice.)</p>
