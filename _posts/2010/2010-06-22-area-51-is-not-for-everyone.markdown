<p>Really, it&#39;s not. Joel says so <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/06/22.html">right here</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Area 51 is not for everyone. If you don’t know what it’s for, or why it’s going to work, or you can’t figure it out, it’s not, actually for you.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/">Go see if it&#39;s for you</a>. It&#39;s probably not. <strong>And that&#39;s OK.</strong></p>
