<p>And I also love it that 13 year old <a href="http://tavi-thenewgirlintown.blogspot.com/">Tavi Gevinson</a>&#39;s done enough great blogging to drive Gawker writers to <a href="http://gawker.com/5471746/an-evening-with-tween-fashion-blogging-sensation-tavi-gevinson?skyline=true&amp;s=i">jealousy-induced fits</a> of apoplexy.</p>

<blockquote><p>To the crowd at China One in the East Village, where last night Brooklyn design duo <a href="http://ilovefactorybk.com/">I Love Factory</a> held a Fashion Week party for a new line of fancy hats, Tavi was a real gut-level, &quot;holy shit!&quot; superstar. Tavi&#39;s entrance—mom and entourage in tow—was heralded by a tectonic shift as partygoers scrambled out of Tavi&#39;s way. Tavi passed through the parted crowd, back to where models showed off the hats. The two syllables of her name filled the room. A semi-circle of fans snapped pictures with their iPhones. The bolder ones approached her, then the party photographer Bronques waved them away so he could get a clear shot. </p></blockquote>
