<p>Yesterday we threw the kids in the car (not <em>quite</em> literally) and after dropping extended family at SFO trekked across 92 to Half Moon Bay.  Yes, it was cold and rainy.  But we needed to get the munchkins out of the house before they destroyed it. And each other. And us.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I emailed friend of the show and HMB resident Andrew Anker and asked him for some restaurant recommendations.  He came through with a great list, and in the spirit of service blogging he&#39;s posted it to quid.pro: <a href="http://www.quid.pro/2010/12/7-places-to-eat-in-half-moon-bay.html">7 Places to Eat in Half Moon Bay</a>. It&#39;s a good list, and more proof that <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/12/my-top-9-songs-of-the-year.html">top tens are so over</a>.</p>
