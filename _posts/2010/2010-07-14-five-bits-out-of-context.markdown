<li><p><a href="http://ruthbourdain.tumblr.com/post/811064136/happy-bastille-day-everyone-im-going-to">Ruth Bourdain</a>:  "Happy Bastille Day everyone! Iâ€™m  going to celebrate by curling up in bed with my 30 lb foie gras pillow and French flag blanket and watch Jacques Tati movies while stoned."</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of foie gras, all it takes is <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/phys-ed-the-men-who-stare-at-screens/?hp">one link from Waxy</a> and I spend the whole day staring at my screen, worrying about my health.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://kottke.org/10/07/how-to-trick-people-into-thinking-youre-good-looking">How to trick people into thinking you're good looking</a> video is excellent, and not quite what the title implies.  The closer is a kicker.</p></li>
<li><p>This is kind of a big deal, if you're into this sort of thing: <a href="http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2010/07/long-hidden-diebenkorns-surface-at-hirshhorn/">Long-hidden Diebenkorns surface at Hirshhorn</a>, complete with photos.  They're gorgeous.</p></li>
<li><p>I like Battelle's bit on <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2010/07/search_foursquare_and_checking_into_states_of_mind.php">checking into states of mind</a>.  Now: mayor of teeth grinding. Later: mayor of scotch-fueled haze?</p></li>
