<p>Former Giants now Rangers catcher Bengie Molina continues to be the best blogger in the major leagues.  His <a href="http://bengiemolina.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/10/who_would_have_thought.html">post last night after the Giants won the National League pennant</a> is a keeper.</p>

<blockquote><p>I know one of the story lines of this Series will be me and Buster Posey, the rookie who replaced me on the Giants. People seem to have a hard time believing that Buster and I have nothing but affection for each other. He&#39;s a talented, smart and humble kid. I appreciate how he conducts himself and the credit he gives me for teaching him a few things. He texts me all the time, including after we won the pennant Friday night. And I texted him and other Giants players tonight, congratulating them. I&#39;m so happy for all of them. I know how hard they worked.</p></blockquote>

<p>On Twitter today KNBR&#39;s Brian Murphy <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/knbrmurph/status/28618415756">replied to a fan&#39;s question</a> &quot;Will the fans boo or cheer Bengie Molina?&quot; with this...</p>

<blockquote><p>Standing O! Bengie was a heart and soul #SFGiant. Show America how we roll.</p></blockquote>

<p>After watching Green Bay boo Brett Favre off the field tonight I damn well hope SF treats Bengie with love and respect. And then kicks his team&#39;s ass.</p>
