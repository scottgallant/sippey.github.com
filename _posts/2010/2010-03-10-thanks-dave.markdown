<p>The news that Issue #60 ("<a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=60">Append file support</a>") in the Quick Search Box for the Mac bug tracker has been marked as "fixed" by Dave MacLachlan will make a vanishingly small number of people exceedingly happy.  </p>

<p><small>And since the other 99.99% of you have no idea what I'm talking about you can move right along.  There's nothing to see here.</small></p>
