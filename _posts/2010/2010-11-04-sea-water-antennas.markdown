<p>BLDBLOG on how the U.S. Navy R&amp;D lab has &quot;engineered a clever scheme to turn the oceanâ€™s most abundant resource into communications equipment, <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2010/11/liquid-radio.html">making antennas out of geysers of seawater</a>.&quot;</p>

<blockquote><p>Turning seawater into a temporary broadcast architecture is absolutely fascinating to me and has some extraordinary design implications for the future. Pirate radio stations made entirely from spiraling pinwheels of saltwater; cell-phone masts disguised as everyday displays spurting seasonally in public parks, from Moscow to Manhattan; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3868590242?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bldgblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=3868590242">TV towers</a> replaced with <a href="http://pruned.blogspot.com/2005/09/milf02-spatializing-marvelous-musicals.html" target="_blank">Busby</a> <a href="http://pruned.blogspot.com/2006/03/landscape-architecture-musical.html" target="_blank">Berkeley</a>-like aquatic extravaganzas, camouflaging the electromagnetic infrastructure of the city as a gigantic water garden. <br /></p></blockquote>

<p>Mind officially blown.</p>
