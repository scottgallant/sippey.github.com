<p>Here's an out-there-on-a-limb tech prediction where I'd be happy to be proven wrong:  <strong>Apple will not announce a tablet on January 26th.</strong></p>

<p><small>You see, I really just ghost blog for <a href="http://hello.typepad.com/">David</a>, who makes a compelling case (i.e. he said it over IM) that it will "just" be a MacBook with a touchscreen.  To which I unimaginatively added a fold around hinge like the tablet PCs, but where you can use your fingers instead of a special pen.  Oh, and some nice content distribution deals and a new packaging format for magazine-style content, a la iTunes albums.  Seriously, though, I'd be very happy to be proven wrong on this.</small></p>
