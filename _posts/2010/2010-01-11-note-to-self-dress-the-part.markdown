<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/arts/design/12muse.html?ref=arts">Roberta Smith</a> weighs in on Deitch going to MOCA: "Mr. Deitch is not just any art dealer. For one thing, despite running a free-form, often funky art gallery — sometimes as a nonprofit, as others have noted — he has always looked like a museum director. His hair is always in place; he wears almost without fail a dark (bespoke?) suit and French cuffs."</p>
