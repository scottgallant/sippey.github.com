<p>I will not be in Austin this year, though the inimitable Paul Ford will be. You should find him and say hello.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#39;ve never been to SxSW before. It surprises some people when I tell them that. It also surprises people when I cry or vomit,
               or get into bed with them well after all the other guests have gone home. But I&#39;ve never had a job where they want to spend
               money to send me places to learn things. I think that&#39;s a very NYC thing; ideas and talent are supposed to come to <i>us</i>, preferably kneeling and begging, not the other way around. This approach is why the finance and publishing industries are
               enjoying such great years.
