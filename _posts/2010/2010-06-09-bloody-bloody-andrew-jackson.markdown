<p>Highly recommended: <em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em>, the emo rock opera at the <a href="http://www.publictheater.org/">Public Theater</a> in New York.  Here&#39;s the lede from the <a href="http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/theater/reviews/07bloody.html">Times review</a>:

</p><blockquote><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the seventh president of the United States is here to take a firsthand look at you the people, and he thinks you’re really hot. You feel the same way about him, right? You’re going to shake, rattle and roll when he makes you the ultimate promise, the one you truly want to hear from anyone who aspires to lead your nation: He solemnly swears to give you the best sex you’ve ever had.</p></blockquote>

<p>Made me want to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812973461?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=statingtheobviou&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812973461">Meacham&#39;s book</a>...though I think I&#39;ll skip a companion Dashboard Confessional soundtrack.</p>
