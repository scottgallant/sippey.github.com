<p><a href="http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2010/08/24/a-letter-to-my-students/">UC Berkeley professor Michael O&#39;Hare writes a letter to his incoming students</a>.  &quot;I’m writing this to you because you are the victims of this enormous cheat (though your children will be even worse off if you don’t take charge of this ship and steer it). Your education was trashed as California fell to the bottom of US states in school spending, and the art classes, AP courses, physical education, working toilets, and teaching generally went by the board.&quot;</p>
