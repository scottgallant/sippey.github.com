Alex Ross reblogs his <a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/2008/07/pavement-1997.html">1997 New Yorker piece on Pavement</a>.

<blockquote><p>A Pavement album is a series of
small labyrinths. The pleasure of the maze matters more than finding a way out.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re a Pavement fan (like me) you&#39;ll read this. If you&#39;re not a Pavement fan, you&#39;re most likely getting ill on the vast amount of ink that music writers have been spilling lately. In that case, best to avoid.</p>
