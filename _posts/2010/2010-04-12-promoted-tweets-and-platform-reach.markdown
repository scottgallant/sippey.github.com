<p>I'm sure Claire Cain Miller's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/technology/internet/13twitter.html?ref=business">piece in the New York Times about Twitter's ad program</a> will be combed over by, well, thousands and thousands of <a href="http://twitter.com/jennyholzer/status/12089469820">experts</a> with fine-toothed combs.  I'll just comb over this particular paragraph.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once Twitter figures out how to measure the number of people who read posts other than on Twitter.com, it will also allow third-party developers to show ads and share revenue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bet we hear more about this piece of the puzzle this week at <a href="http://chirp.twitter.com/">Chirp</a>. The strength of Twitter is in its reach as a platform...but from an advertiser's perspective the weakness of Twitter is in the (current) inability to measure the actual reach (vs. <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/12/life-on-the-list.html" title="Anil Dash's post about life on the Suggested User List">potential reach</a>) of a message.  So if I'm reading Miller's paragraph correctly (and she's transmitting correctly), the bargain for third-party developers is pretty clear: you share stats about who's seeing what tweets when and where, and we'll share ad revenue with you.</p>

<p>And you know what?  This is <em>just like every other online ad network.</em>  And this is a good thing; it's a value exchange that's easy to understand.  Take <a href="http://www.google.com/services/adsense_tour/howitworks.html">AdSense</a>, for instance.  Every microsecond of every day publishers give Google real estate on their sites. Google gets to learn all sorts of things about their traffic patterns -- who reads what pages when and from where; in return the publisher gets a cut of the advertising revenue that Google generates in that real estate. Data for revenue.</p>

<p>I also think this puts the Blackberry and iPhone client moves last week in context.  Now that they have Twitter-branded clients on two large mobile platforms, they have healthy chunk of owned &amp; operated mobile inventory.  Which means they don't need to negotiate the revenue cut with any third party developers for the initial launch, and they can take a while to learn -- gather data, observe the user experience, gauge advertiser reaction, etc.  And it will give them an opportunity to develop a set of best practices for clients about how to report this kind of data back to Twitter.</p>

<p>They're doing this right.  The tweet's a natural ad unit, and they're finding the right ways to introduce them into the user experience.  Search first, tweet stream on their own O&amp;O properties next, then out through third party clients. Evolve the right way to make it a net positive for the ecosystem. Evolve the "resonance" algorithm. Get a handle on the reach of the platform. And all the while encourage new types of applications.</p>

<p>Here we go.</p>
