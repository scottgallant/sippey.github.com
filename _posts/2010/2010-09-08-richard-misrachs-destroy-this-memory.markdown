<p><a href="http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2010/09/misrach-destroy-this-memory/">Tyler Green on Richard Misrach's new book</a> of post-Katrina photos of New Orleans, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597111635?ie=UTF8&tag=statingtheobviou&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1597111635">Destroy This Memory</a>:  "Consider Misrachâ€™s book an affirmation that artists can bring strikingly different, equally valuable points-of-view to the same subject and that their contributions to story-telling and creating our collective memory are every bit as valuable as journalism or oral history."</p>

<p>I had a chance to look through the book this past weekend, and it's an incredible piece of work.  Shot with a 4MP point and shoot, Misrach deftly sidesteps the temptation of turning the flood destruction into beautiful images; instead, each photo features graffiti left by survivors. Every photo has its own story, but taken together they all say one thing: Fuck You, Katrina.</p>
