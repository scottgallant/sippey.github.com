<p>Jason Chen, in the pre-game <a href="http://live.gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo liveblog</a> of the Apple announcement:  "Weâ€™re still about 10 minutes away from the event starting. I wonder if the guys backstage are vomiting from nervousness. I would be."</p>

<p>I didn't <em>actually</em> vomit, but yes. That's the feeling. And thinking about it now makes my palms sweat and my stomach churn, a year and a half later. What got me through it was the support from the fantastic people at Apple, who I'm thinking about today.</p>
