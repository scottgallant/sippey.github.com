<p>I had lunch last week with a writer I admire and whose work I love. It was one of those perfect San Francisco days; cool breeze, warm sun, and we sat on the stoop across from Little Skillet and enjoyed some fried chicken and cole slaw. We talked about media, magazines, book publishing, the iPad, blogging, etc.  A perfect hour. </p>

<p>At one point she asked how I got started blogging, and why I write. Without thinking, my stock answer came out: I've always written to think through a problem, to understand what I really think about a particular topic. </p>

<p>"Do you enjoy it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes!" I said, without really thinking about it.</p>

<p>"Ha!  I hate writing," she said. "I like <em>having written</em>."</p>
