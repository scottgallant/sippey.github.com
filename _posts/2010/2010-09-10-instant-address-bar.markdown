<p>Here&#39;s an interaction design problem that I&#39;m sure someone at Google is working on: how to integrate the <a href="http://www.google.com/instant/" target="_self">Google Instant</a> experience into Chrome, without resorting to the obvious solution of splitting a search box from the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95440" target="_self">address bar</a>...or losing the ability open addresses, or search the combination of your bookmarks and browser history.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: &#0160;of course right after I post this Ken Norton <a href="http://twitter.com/kennethn/status/24139406305" target="_self">points me</a> to a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/08/google-instant-chrome/" target="_self">TechCrunch post</a> about Instant coming to Chrome. #whatevs</p>
