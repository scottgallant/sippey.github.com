<p><a href="http://www.svpg.com/top-10-reasons-for-weak-product/">Marty Cagan&#39;s top 10 reasons for a weak product</a>.  Bug report -- there are actually 11 in his list.  But who&#39;s counting.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s number 10:  &quot;Lack of corporate courage.  Doing something significant typically requires taking some risk.  We have several techniques to mitigate this risk (protecting the companyâ€™s brand and revenue), but still there is risk.  Sometimes it is the team that is scared to take the risks, and other times it is the leaders that are scared.  But many organizations let fear constrain their products from moving forwards.&quot;</p>

<p>Relatedly, I&#39;m reading David Kirkpatrick&#39;s <a href="http://amzn.to/9Dmoss">book on Facebook</a>, and just got to the point where Zuckerberg pushed through the backlash over the news feed, with the realization that so many people were able to organize so quickly against the feature <i>because</i> of the feature.</p>
