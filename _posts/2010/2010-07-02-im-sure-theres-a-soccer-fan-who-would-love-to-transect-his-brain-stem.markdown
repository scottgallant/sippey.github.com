<p>Frog's Design Mind <a href="http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/of-soccer-and-snobbery.html">blog</a> points to a piece in the New English review on <a href="http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm/frm/66894/sec_id/66894">Soccer and Snobbery</a>, calling out a quote that uses the word "<strong>decerebating</strong>."  As in "The decerebrating effect of football (and no doubt other sports as well) is illustrated by..." blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p>Oh, <a href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/decerebrating">decerebrating</a>! Of course.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>decerebrate</strong> -- to eliminate cerebral function by transecting the brain stem or by ligating the common carotid arteries and basilar artery at the center of the pons; an animal so prepared, or a brain-damaged person with similar neurologic signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can think of better ways to decerebrate than by transecting my brain stem.  Not sure where I'm going with this, other than <em>of course</em> the guy who uses the word "decerebrating" thinks that sports make us stupid.  Jerk.</p>
