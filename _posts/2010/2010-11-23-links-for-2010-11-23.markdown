                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;It would be nice if we all stood behind our words instead of erecting walls of disclaimers in front of them. But it’s also human to want to mitigate people’s reactions when we say something negative. The phrases, in this sense, operate as almost a fingers-crossed superstitious protection: &#039;If I say ‘no offense,’ maybe he won’t punch me!&#039;&quot;</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;Newsflash to the mainstream media: just like you have actual human beings making you work, so does the Internet! A little respect for the people providing your content would be nice! I understand that ownership is a dubious concept these days, and that I&#039;m claiming ownership of a series of clips that I never owned in the first place, but an idea is an idea. They&#039;re so hard to come by and so, so valuable.&quot;</div>
