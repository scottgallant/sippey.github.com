<p>Terry Gross <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127745800">interviews LCD Soundsystem&#39;s James Murphy</a>.  I loved this bit about the job of being in a band, and the shift he&#39;s going to make...</p>

<blockquote><p>There are a lot of things I&#39;d like to do that I can&#39;t really do because I have this job. So I thought like three albums — a nice trilogy over a decade — it feels like a good time to stop being a professional band. That doesn&#39;t mean LCD will stop. It just means I&#39;ll go back to the beginning: releasing a track here and there or being more fluid about my decision-making rather than albums, videos, singles, tour. Rather than this professional arch of being in a band, I&#39;d like to go back to being a person who decides what he likes to do and pursues something new once in a while.</p></blockquote>

<p>His sign-off is worthwhile, too, but I won&#39;t spoil it for you.</p>
