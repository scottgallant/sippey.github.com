<blockquote><p>“How’s that hopey-changey thing workin’ out for you?”</p></blockquote>

<p><small>via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/us/politics/08palin.html?hp">www.nytimes.com</a></small></p>

<p>So when the New York Times quotes Sarah Palin like this, do they do shorten the word &quot;working&quot; to &quot;workin&#39;&quot; themselves? If it&#39;s just her accent / manner of speaking, then shouldn&#39;t they be doing that for every quote they transcribe? (Did they do this for Clinton, for example?)  On the flipside, if they&#39;re not shortening this themselves, and actually getting the quote from the teleprompter transcript, then is Palin&#39;s camp writing in the shortened form of the word in order to make sure she hits the homey accents?</p>
