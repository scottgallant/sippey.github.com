<blockquote><p>Anyway: Dave Eggers! I am writing to compare him to Wyndham Lewis, because while there is definitely something to not like about him, there is a lot to praise. Quite a lot! There is great worth in Dave Eggers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Maria Bustillos tries really (really!) hard to say good things about Dave Eggers, and compares him to Wyndham Lewis.  Which I guess is a good thing?</p>

<p>Me?  I&#39;ve never met Dave Eggers.  But I like some of his books!  And The Believer sure is neat.  And I was surprised at how much I liked <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> because I don&#39;t think it was really that &quot;twee&quot; and was actually quite a sophisticated story...  But what do I know.  I don&#39;t write for The Awl, and I don&#39;t know enough about Wyndham Lewis to know whether or not Ms. Bustillos is being ironical.</p>
