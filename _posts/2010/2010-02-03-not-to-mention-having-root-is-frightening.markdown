<p>Not surprisingly, I really like <a href="http://weblog.muledesign.com/2010/02/the_failure_of_empathy.php">Mike Monteiro&#39;s take on the iPad</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>As an industry, we need to understand that not wanting root access doesnâ€™t make you stupid. It simply means you do not want root access. Failing to comprehend this is not only a failure of empathy, but a failure of service.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, there&#39;s a great diagram which I won&#39;t steal for my blog but instead will mention as a way to entice you to <a href="http://weblog.muledesign.com/2010/02/the_failure_of_empathy.php">click through</a>.</p>
