<p>Sports Illustrated&#39;s Joe Posnanski has a <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/joe_posnanski/10/29/rangers.giants.insider/index.html?eref=sihp">great piece up today about Matt Cain&#39;s no nonsense approach to executing his pitches</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>And as he talked, I was reminded of my favorite Matt Cain answer of the postseason. It was on Wednesday, and the talk was about nerves, and the question was this: &quot;How do you sleep the night before a start in the World Series?&quot;</p>       <p>And Matt Cain&#39;s answer was this: &quot;Close your eyes.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Love. It.</p>
