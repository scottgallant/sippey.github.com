<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/38722872">UBS is incorporating satellite data in its reports on Wal-Mart</a>.  &quot;By counting the cars in Wal-Mart’s parking lots month in and month out, Remote Sensing Metrics analysts were able to get a fix on the company’s customer flow. From there, they worked up a mathematical regression to come up with a prediction of the company’s quarterly revenue each month.&quot; UBS didn&#39;t comment on whether they&#39;re also including keystroke data from Stephen Wolfram in their analysis.</p>
