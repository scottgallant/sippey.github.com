<p>John Scharffenberger (just typing the name makes my mouth water...) is <a href="http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/12/17/john-scharffenberger-first-wine-then-chocolate-now-tofu/">now CEO of Hodo Soy Beanery</a>, &quot;an artisan food factory that makes products from organic, non-GMO soybeans.&quot;</p>
<p>Prediction: gourmet tofu will go mainstream in the next 24 months.</p>
