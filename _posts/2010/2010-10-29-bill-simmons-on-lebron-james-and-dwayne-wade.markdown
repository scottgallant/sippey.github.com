<p>I read this <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/10129&amp;sportCat=nba">excellent post from Bill Simmons</a> about the Miami v. Boston game this week, and in the back of my head keep hearing that line from the Highlander series*: &quot;There can be only one.&quot;</p>

<blockquote><p>LeBron and Wade are creators in a decidedly modern way: scorers first, then passers if they can&#39;t score. <i>I got this.</i> That&#39;s how players think in the post-Jordan, AAU-dominated, microwavable fame era. That&#39;s how you earn the most money, generate the most attention, land shoe commercials and end up producing one-hour shows in which you pick your next team. You can&#39;t expect two superstars in their primes to suddenly shut off the &quot;I got this&quot; switch. It&#39;s not realistic.</p></blockquote>

<p><small>* Shut up. You know exactly what I&#39;m talking about. Don&#39;t try to pretend you don&#39;t.</small></p>
