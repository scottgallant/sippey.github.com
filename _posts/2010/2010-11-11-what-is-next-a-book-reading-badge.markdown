<p>THEKRUSER.COM has an <a href="http://thekruser.com/foursquare/alphabetical">obsessive catalog</a> of Foursquare badges (by event, by location, by active/inactive) and brands to follow. I loved this editorial remark, though, about The Healthy Crane badge:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Remarks:</strong> In my opinion, this series of badges should not exist.  Foursquare is a LOCATION bassed game.  This badge is based on an ACCOMPLISHMENT.  If they keep this stuff up, they will dilute the badge pool with badges that have nothing to do with location at all.  What is next?  A book reading badge?!?</p></blockquote>

<p>I wish THEKRUSER.COM organized these chronologically, and plotted the evolution of badge design over time so that he could accurately predict the inevitable appearance of the book reading badge.</p>
