<p>Here&#39;s the lede of the blog post <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/12/introducing-google-latitude-app-for.html">announcing the new Google Latitude app for iPhone</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Where are you?”</p>
<p>Starting today, you’ll never again have to answer (or ask) that question when you’re on the go with your iPhone.  With the new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-latitude/id306586497?mt=8">Google Latitude app for iPhone</a>, you can see where your friends are and now, continuously share where you are – even in the background once you’ve closed the app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it just me, or is leading with this &quot;benefit&quot; incredibly tone deaf? The mainstream media is awash with stories about how consumers are being tracked eight ways from Sunday, and Google decides that <em>continuously sharing your physical location with them</em> is the best way to sell their new app?</p>
