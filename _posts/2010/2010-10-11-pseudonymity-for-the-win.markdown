<p>Entertainment Weekly <a href="http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/10/11/banksy-simpsons-al-jean/">interviews The Simpsons producer Al Jean</a> about the Banksy opening sequence.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Did you learn more about the identity of Banksy?</strong><br />
I never met him. Even my emails back and forth to him, I would email Bonnie, who would email his producer, who would email him. I’m pretty sure it’s really him because if it wasn’t him, the real Banksy would have said something.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>But would he have?</strong> If you were the real Banksy, and you <em>didn&#39;t actually do this</em>, you probably wouldn&#39;t come forward, because &quot;you&quot; had just pulled off a tremendous media hack, without lifting a finger.</p>

<p><small>Note:  I don&#39;t use phrases like &quot;For the Win&quot; lightly.</small></p>
