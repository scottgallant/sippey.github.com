<p>Every once in a while I get lucky and actually state the obvious.  Here's a bit from <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/02/siri-was-worth-the-wait.html">my post on Siri back in February</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since Apple won't let users customize what's triggered with a long press of the iPhone's home button, they should just buy the company and turn this into the default Voice Control app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm very happy to read this morning that <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2010/04/28/breaking-news-siri-bought-by-apple/">Siri's been acquired by Apple</a>. Congrats to the Siri team (yay Harry!); this makes perfect sense for both companies. And if you haven't tried <a href="http://siri.com/">Siri</a> -- go get it now.</p>
