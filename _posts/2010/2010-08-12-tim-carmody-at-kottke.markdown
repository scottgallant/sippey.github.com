<p>I sure love me some Jason Kottke, but I&#39;m going to miss <a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/~carmody/Home.html" target="_self">Tim Carmody</a> when he&#39;s gone from <a href="http://kottke.org/" target="_self">kottke.org</a>. He&#39;s been on fire this week; I love today&#39;s post <a href="http://kottke.org/10/08/the-city-is-a-hypertext" target="_self">The city is a hypertext</a> for connecting &quot;the arguments we have about the cognitive effect of reading for the web are largely a replay of the upheaval surrounding mass urbanization at the turn of the century.&quot;</p>
