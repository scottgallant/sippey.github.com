<p><a href="http://gawker.com/5668356/fcc-responds-to-cablevision+fox-dispute-by-tweeting-baseball-scores">Gawker reports on the FCC live tweeting baseball scores to keep Fox-less Cablevision customers in the know</a>.  &quot;What was a funny publicity stunt—intended, one imagines, to keep pressure on the two companies to strike a deal—also serves as a reminder of how powerless the government agency is in this situation. Unable to step in and do anything besides call the companies&#39; CEOs and ask them to figure something out, the FCC is reduced to a scorekeeper. Literally!&quot;</p>
