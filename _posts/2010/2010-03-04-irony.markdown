<p>Instapaper 2.2 on the iPhone is <a href="http://ben.stupidfool.org/typepad/2010/02/pagination-in-instapaper.html">really good</a>.  So much so that I'm now Instapapering things that I know I should read eventually, but that in browser cry out for "tl,dr[1]" snark. Like, say, Gruber's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/03/this_apple_htc_patent_thing">opus on the Apple patent cluster</a>.</p>

<p><small>[1] Too long, didn't read.</small></p>
