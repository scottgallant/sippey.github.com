<p>Edward's Champion's reviews are always worth reading, and his <a href="http://www.edrants.com/review-inception-2010/">new review of <em>Inception</em></a> is no exception, especially since it's studded with gems like "It’s never a wise idea to name a protagonist after a salad" and "as dead as a greedy investment banker’s onyx soul."  But I think the premise of his negative take on the movie is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nolan has been given a $160 million budget to get a mass audience to confront its deepest visceral fantasies, but, with Inception, the collected reveries resemble a pedestrian heist movie. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I somehow doubt that the studio approved a nine figure budget to fund an enormous psychotherapy experiment. Instead, I think they probably wanted a heist movie with a hot star, cool visual effects and a hook that would drive some pre-release mystery and intrigue. You know, a summer blockbuster?</p>
