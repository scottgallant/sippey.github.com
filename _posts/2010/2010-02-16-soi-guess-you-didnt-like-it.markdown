	I'll confess that I was sort of looking forward to Peter Gabriel's album of covers. <a href="http://www.fluxblog.org/2010/02/the-strain-i-am-under">Fluxblog's Matthew Perpetua tears it apart</a>. When Perpetua loves something he lets you know...and when he hates something, well, you get gems like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Peter Gabrielâ€™s new album of covers, Scratch My Back, is one of the most mesmerizingly awful records I have ever encountered. It is terrible in a way that seems unique and special; hideous in a way that is possibly quite profound. His selection of material is fine, but his execution is horrendous, to the point of obliterating the appeal of every song.</p></blockquote>

<p>Go read the whole thing, especially the bits where he tears into Gabriel's cover of Radiohead's "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" and has to resort to all caps.</p>
