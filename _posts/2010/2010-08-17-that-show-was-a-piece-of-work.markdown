<p><a href="http://williampowhida.blogspot.com/2010/08/work-of-art-rant.html" target="_self">William Powhida pens a massive rant on Bravo&#39;s Work of Art</a>. &#0160;Here&#39;s a representative sample. &#0160;&quot;That Bravo reduced art to series of BFA level challenges was arguably the most artificial and insulting part of the show for me. I mean, beyond the fact they have an absurd shooting schedule and severe time restrictions. On his FB page, @Jerrysaltz asked his thousands what challenges they would issue. OK. So, let’s just get this fucking straight. Would it be cool if I just went on my FB page and asked “Hey kids, what should I do next?” Of course fucking not, it’s the central challenge for an artist. &#39;What the fuck do I do?&#39;&quot;</p>
