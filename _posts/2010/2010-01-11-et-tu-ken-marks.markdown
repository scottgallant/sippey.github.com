<p>File under &quot;the things you do for love,&quot; but we took the kids to see <i>The Squeakquel</i> over the holidays. It was possibly the worst movie I&#39;ve ever paid to see in the theater. But The New Yorker&#39;s Ken Marks <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/alvin_and_the_chipmunks_the_squeakquel_thomas">disagreed</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The visages of the rockinâ€™ rodents are, in fact, remarkably expressive, the jokes are reasonably funny, the lesson of sticking by your pals is not too corny, and the battle-of-the-bands finale, in which Toby accepts some grownup responsibility and finds love in the process, is surprisingly moving.</p></blockquote>

<p>/me puts head in hands.</p>
