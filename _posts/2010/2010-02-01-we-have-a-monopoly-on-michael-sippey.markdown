<p>Two great things about <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/02/01/all-the-many-ways-amazon-so-very-failed-the-weekend/">John Scalzi&#39;s wrap up</a> of the Amazon / Macmillan cluster this weekend.  First, this bit:</p>

<blockquote><p>The letter took time to praise Amazon but also did some interesting rhetorical heavy lifting — for example, labeling Amazon a “customer” of Macmillan rather than a “partner,” which is a fun corporate way of jamming Amazon into an ecological niche it probably would prefer not to be in.</p></blockquote>

<p>Second, Scalzi&#39;s changed the descriptive slug on his blog to read &quot;We have a monopoly on John Scalzi.&quot;  Nice.</p>

<p>But since his post is trending on Techmeme, I wish that Scalzi had a bit more to say about how the only real winner here is Apple. Not only because this weekend&#39;s drama has the potential to drive passionate readers away from Amazon and to Apple, but also because the only way Macmillan&#39;s tough guy bargaining position re. the &quot;agency model&quot; would have been possible is because of iBookstore.</p>
