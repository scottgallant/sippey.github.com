<p><a href="http://gawker.com/5613967/mad-men-out-of-focus-group" target="_self">Brian Moylan at Gawker goes all psychoanalytic on last night&#39;s Mad Men</a>: &#0160;&quot;We know exactly what Don is going to do because he keeps making the same mistakes over and over again. In his mind he can break free, but we&#39;re going to have to see if his behavior matches up to the perception he has of himself.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theawl.com/2010/08/footnotes-of-mad-men-the-two-way-mirror-and-social-anomie" target="_self">Meanwhile, Choire Sicha at The Awl goes all art historian on the mid-60s</a>, (ab)using Dan Graham&#39;s mirror pieces to push last night&#39;s metaphor to the breaking point. &quot;And still later, [Graham]&#39;d turn to the two-way mirror, just as our callow, lady-baiting shrink focus-grouper on &#39;Mad Men&#39; does. &#39;Two-way mirror used in office buildings is always totally reflective on the exterior, reflecting the sunlight and transparent for workers inside. Surveillance power is given to the corporate tower,&#39; wrote Graham.&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, Mad Men: the rorschach test of the New York media blogger crew.</p>
