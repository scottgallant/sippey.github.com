<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/business/media/18adco.html?_r=2">Jay-Z&#39;s new book <cite>Decoded</cite> will be promoted by reprinting pages of the book in the places mentioned in the book, combined with a treasure hunt run and sponsored by Bing</a>.  &quot;While about half of the pages will be displayed in traditional outdoor advertising like billboards, the rest will be offbeat, printed in one instance on the bottom of a hotel swimming pool, in another on the lining of jackets in a store display window, and in another on the felt of pool tables in a pool hall.&quot; Oh, and online the <cite>Decoded</cite> billboards will be superimposed on Bing 3-D maps.</p>

<p>I&#39;d <em>love</em> to see the presentation that Droga5 used to pitch this idea.</p>
