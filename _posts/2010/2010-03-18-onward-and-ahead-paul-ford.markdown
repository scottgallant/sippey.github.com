<blockquote><p>You know what happened, really and without irony? I had an opportunity to be an editor at <i>Harper&#39;s</i>, to edit pieces for the magazine. It was something I expected to really want. I had wonderful editors to learn from. I did a little of it for print and a lot for the web. I wasn&#39;t bad at it, even. Not great, but not bad. I could have been a respected editor instead of a huge nerd. But all the editing in the world can&#39;t compare to building little websites and mangling text and writing things and messing around in spreadsheets and figuring out what&#39;s wrong with comments.  I wake up thinking about how all the pieces fit together and I want to do more of it and with lots of people. I plan to be scared and exhausted most of the time. So far that&#39;s working.</p>

<p>Choire catches up with Paul Ford now that he&#39;s left Harper&#39;s and is working with our friend Mr. Dash at Activate.  The whole interview is great, but it&#39;s the &quot;without irony&quot; bit that&#39;s fantastic.</p>
