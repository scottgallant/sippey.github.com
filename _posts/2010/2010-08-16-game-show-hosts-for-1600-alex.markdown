<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2010/08/16/100816sh_shouts_rich" target="_self">Who is Alex Trebek?</a> &quot;$1,600: This game-show host has been mocked by comedians for decades and made to look like a fool on national television in front of his family. He never complains, because he is a good sport, but, at the end of the day, heâ€™s still a human being and obviously the mean impersonations sometimes hurt the feelings of this host.&quot; In a perfect world this blog post would have won me a Supernerd badge for blogging a New Yorker shouts and murmurs piece about Jeopardy. Then I could have shared that badge on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
