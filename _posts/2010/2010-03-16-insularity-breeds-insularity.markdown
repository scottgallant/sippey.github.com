<p>Great <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/benyamin-cohen/6-questions-for-an-atheis_b_489144.html">interview at HuffPo with Gina Welch</a>, the Berkeley-raised[1] author of the new book <i>In the Land of Believers</i>, in which she documents her two years of being &quot;undercover&quot; at <a href="http://home.trbc.org/">Jerry Falwell&#39;s church</a> in Lynchburg, Virginia.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>What was the biggest surprise you found during your journey?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest surprise for me was the individual reflectiveness of church members. I think I&#39;d had this stereotype of evangelicals as blisteringly arrogant dogmatists. But I observed instead humility and a kind of obsessive self-reflection, enacted through prayer. They call it listening to God&#39;s voice, but from it seemed to me like a constant internal pat-down of conscience, which really resulted in care with choices, and a movingly ample capacity for selflessness and generosity. I learned a lot by their example.</p>

<p>A secondary surprise was that I felt implicated in the ignorance I observed -- relating to gay rights, to the environment, to feminism. I started to believe that their reactionary attitudes on these subjects were a result of profound insularity, which itself seemed the legacy of a culture that rejected them: mine. Why would they open themselves up to influence from a culture that made no space for their beliefs?</p></blockquote>
