<p><a href="http://perpetua.tumblr.com/post/978561986/whats-your-favorite-cover-and-or-if-you-could-hear">Matthew Perpetua on his favorite cover</a>. &quot;The best cover version I can think of is Sinead O’Connor’s version of &#39;Nothing Compares 2 U.&#39; ... The song is absolutely brilliant, one of the best Prince has ever written, and O’Connor rescued it from obscurity and turned it into one of the most emotionally devastating pop hits of all time. Prince’s versions are okay, but never really get it right — he always makes it sound too syrupy, and the stakes never seem very high. Sinead makes you hang on every syllable, every moment is life or death. It’s a truly incredible performance.&quot;</p>
