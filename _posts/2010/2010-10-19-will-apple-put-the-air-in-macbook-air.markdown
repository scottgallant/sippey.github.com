<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/new-macbook-air-coming-wed-bigger-battery-sharper-case-independent-confirmation/64190" target="_self">In all of the rumors and speculation about tomorrow&#39;s Apple announcement</a> and new Macbook Airs, I&#39;m surprised by something. In all of the discussion re. hardware, there&#39;s been nothing mentioned about an integrated wireless modem. An 11.6&quot; MacBook Air with an integrated 3G modem would be an interesting addition to the product &amp; price point line up. &#0160;Has the rumor / leak mill just missed this one, or does that veer too close to iPad land?</p>
