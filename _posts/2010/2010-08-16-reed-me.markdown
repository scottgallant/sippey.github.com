<p><a href="http://twitter.com/reederapp/status/21236577722">Reeder for Mac coming?</a> I&#39;m a huge fan of Reeder on the iPhone and iPad; so much so that pretty much all of my feed reading happens there now.  (Insert usual bit about those devices being great for content consumption, etc.)  So I&#39;m conflicted about Reeder for the Mac, but will probably end up buying it anyway; they make nice software.</p>
