<p><a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2010/08/14/how-oracle-might-kill-googles-android-and-software-patents-all-at-once/">RoughlyDrafted on the Oracle and Google patent fracas</a>. &quot;If Oracle is successful in its bid to &#39;impound and destroy&#39; the heart of Googleâ€™s Android, it might result in more than just a massive upheaval of the smartphone industry and a congratulatory high fiving between Jobs and Ellison. It might also result in a concerted effort by Google to join Oracle and other tech giants to decommission the nuclear threat of software patent proliferation in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I completely buy his line of reasoning (1994 is quite a while ago, and I can&#39;t imagine Google and Oracle joining hands over much of anything after this battle), but the piece is worth reading. And oh, buried in it is an amazing parenthetical aside.</p>
