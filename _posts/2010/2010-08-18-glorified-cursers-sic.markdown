<p><a href="http://henryjenkins.org/2010/08/no_you_do_not_have_to_be_a_gam.html" target="_self">Henry Jenkins elaborates on his quotes re. Inception as a movie for gamers</a>. Finally got around to reading this (thanks, Instapaper!). There&#39;s a lot to enjoy here, but I liked this bit. &#0160;&quot;The very nature of an interactive narrative serves to strip characters of psychological depth -- game characters are often glorified cursers, vehicles we use to move through the game worlds, rather than characters into whom we project sophisticated motives or anticipate character development.&quot;</p>
