<p>More on MOCA&#39;s new director:  Tyler Green scores the first <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2010/01/qa_with_incoming_moca_director_2.html">in-depth interview with Jeffrey Deitch</a>; available at Modern Art Notes in three parts.*  It&#39;s worth reading in full to understand how Deitch sees the transition from private dealer to public institution...</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&#39;t feel that I am going into a completely different world, but a lot of the same people, same principles. ... It&#39;s obviously quite different going from the private sector that is commercial-sector, to the public sector supported by contributions and some revenue streams that have nothing to do with the commerce of art. But I feel that what I&#39;ve been doing at Deitch Projects is in a way running my own private institute of contemporary art. I&#39;ve just been using the market system to support it rather than contributions to support it. I&#39;ve run a program that has non-commercial historical exhibits, historical exhibits with little or nothing for sale. [I&#39;ve also done] projects that engage a large, young community like <a href="http://www.deitch.com/projects/sub.php?projId=231">Michel Gondry&#39;s mini-film studio</a>, which cost a fortune to produce but with no chance to get any commercial revenue.</p></blockquote>

<p><small>* Score one for the bloggers; Green&#39;s interview scoops not only all the major art pubs, but also the Los Angeles (and, for that matter, the New York) Times.</small></p>
