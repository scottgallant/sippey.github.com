<p>Mat Honan on what comes next with Gawkergate: <a href="http://www.emptyage.com/post/2314157453/will-we-see-a-great-gawker-troll-hunt">troll hunt!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll be amazed if in the coming weeks we don’t learn several identities behind a lot of the Gawker commenter accounts. Sometimes it might be because the commenter had a clear bias or conflict of interest they should have disclosed. Others it’s just going to be because a famous person is involved. (And have you seen how many famous people—celebrities and media bigwigs—there are in there?) And of course sometimes names will just come out because someone is a dick.</p>
