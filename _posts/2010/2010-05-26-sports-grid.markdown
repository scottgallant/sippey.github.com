<p>Rex Sorgatz (for Dan Abrams) launches <a href="http://www.sportsgrid.com/">Sports Grid</a>, which I think could be (inadequately, narrow-mindedly) pitched as "ESPN meets The Awl."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our goal is a simple one: to cover the culture of sports and entertainment, as well as the media personalities who talk and write about it, in a fun, compelling and easy to consume way. Perhaps more importantly, we also aim to objectively rank the legions of participants of our favorite pastimes by tracking who is – at any given moment – receiving the most “buzz” from his or her actions on and off the field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theory:  Sports Grid is a bet to build a future home for <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/simmons/index">Bill Simmons</a>, whose contract with ESPN is up this summer. In the sports media world, he's the free agent that matters.  Which I now know <em>for a fact</em>, thanks to the Sports Grid <a href="http://www.sportsgrid.com/power-grid/writers/">Power Grid for writers</a>.</p>
