<p>David is on to something with this idea for a browser extension.  &quot;Oh!  You think <i>that</i> article is interesting?  Well you should check out the one that <i>really</i> matters.  You&#39;ll thank us later.&quot;  Or instead of a browser extension imagine a campus-wide proxy server that detects and automatically redirects based on student browsing activity. (Included free with your tuition!) We&#39;ll call that act of redirecting GETTING BLASTED BY THE CANON.</p>
