<p>They&#39;re <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/12/the_best_feature_films_of_2010.html">here</a>; I particularly enjoyed this bit about his top pick, <cite>The Social Network</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tension in the film is between Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins, who may well have invented Facebook for all I know, but are traditional analog humans motivated by pride and possessiveness. If Zuckerberg took their idea and ran with it, it was because he saw it as a logical insight rather than intellectual property. Some films observe fundamental shifts in human nature, and this is one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also? Sounds like I really need to see <cite>The American</cite>.</p>
