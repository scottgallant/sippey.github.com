<p>Adam Mathes <a href="http://trenchant.org/daily/2010/1/6/">digs up</a> a <a href="http://www.beigerecords.com/select.html">great interview</a> with <a href="http://www.post-data.org/~paul/">Paul Davis</a> from Select Magazine in 2001.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>every bit, every representation, every piece of information in a computer is yours to f--- with. and the potential always exists for you to acknowledge that a computer is completely programmable in every aspect and that itâ€™s most powerful function is to facilitate tool creation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn't really say "f---".</p>
