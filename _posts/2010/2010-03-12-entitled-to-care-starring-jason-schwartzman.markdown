<blockquote><p>But, then we also find ourselves having to beg them to face the non-negotiable reality of a scary, complicated, and hard-to-monetize new environment where nobody cares how attached you are to your spreadsheet. Bravely vowing to continue pretending  it’s 1972 is a terrific treatment for a film, but it’s a crap way to run your growing business.</p>

<p>Merlin&#39;s piece about entitlements and business model dirt naps is worth reading in full.  </p>

<p>But the little bit excerpted makes me think that this <b>would</b> make a terrific film.  Directed by Wes Anderson, Jason Schwartzman stars as a young, inherited-wealth magazine publisher who bravely vows to continue to pretend it&#39;s 1972, while all around him people in distressed jeans, sneakers and ironic t-shirts whiz past with their iPads and their Foursquare checkins.</p>

<p>OK, now that I think about it...maybe not.</p>
