<blockquote>
<p>So there I was, shoving pie in my face like a fat girl who didn&#39;t get asked to prom, when I heard my mother rambling on to someone who was pretending to give a shit about how much she loved being a mother.</p>
<p>Cue: Daisy guffawing.</p>
<p>&quot;What? I loved being a mother,&quot; My mother rebuffed.</p>
<p>And then, with a smile on my face, and truly no harm (okay, fine, very little harm) intended, I said, &quot;Right. Which is why you sent your only daughter to boarding school when she was fourteen.&quot;</p>

<p>Note:  I just updated Google Reader and moved Daisy&#39;s blog from the &quot;Friends&quot; category to the &quot;Parenting&quot; category. While she&#39;s still a good friend, I think she&#39;s a great mommy blogger.</p>
