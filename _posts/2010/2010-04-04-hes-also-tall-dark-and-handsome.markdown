<p>The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/business/media/05remnick.html">plants a wet one on David Remnick</a>, literary super hero.</p>

<blockquote><p>He reports, writes and edits, a player-coach combination that works in magazine about as often as a Bill Russell shows up in the National Basketball Association; his families, writers and advertising clients feel like they are his focus; and he counts pennies at one of the most luxe publishing companies in the world.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to editing The New Yorker, Remnick has a 672-page <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400043603/ref=nosim/statingtheobviou">biography</a> of Barack Obama coming out this week. Just the thought of <i>reading</i> that book makes me exhausted.</p>
