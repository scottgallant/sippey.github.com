<blockquote>
<p>Lately, it has become commonplace in the Valley to shift focus away from founders and put it on the investors. Some might argue that in case of RockMelt, it <em>was</em> the investor connection that made the story worthy of attention. (I would disagree with them.) To me those are the wrong reasons to pay attention to a company and its technology.</p>

<p>I&#39;m enjoying reading Om Malik&#39;s posts lately; he&#39;s become the voice of reason in tech blogs.  Two thumbs up for this latest post, where he argues for a shift in attention back to the entrepreneur and away from the investors. Marc Andreessen is a nice story hook for RockMelt, of course, but the mgmt team, the product they create and the business they build around it are what&#39;s going to make RockMelt interesting over time...</p>
<p>(Re. RockMelt itself, I&#39;m not sold yet. It&#39;s a gutsy move to have Facebook identity baked in at such a fundamental level. It could be that I&#39;m just getting old, but having all the Twitter and FB friends and feeds right there everywhere I go feels really distracting.  Maybe it&#39;ll end up being a mood / mode thing?)</p>
