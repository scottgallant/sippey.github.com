<p>Via <a href="http://twitter.com/themexican">@themexican</a> comes this <a href="http://twitter.com/liabulaong/status/10604770253">nugget</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/liabulaong">@liabulong</a>:</p>

  <p>don't think i've ever read anything in my life that screams "san francisco!" as much as this story's first paragraph: <a href="http://is.gd/aLm97">http://is.gd/aLm97</a></p>

<p>And because she's so right, and it's so good, I had to share.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>(03-16) 18:30 PDT SAN FRANCISCO</strong> -- An ex-vegan who was hit with chili pepper-laced pies at an anarchist event in San Francisco said Tuesday that her assailants were cowards who should direct their herbivorous rage at the powerful - not at a fellow radical for writing a book denouncing animal-free diets.</p>

<p>I love this town.</p>

<p><small>PS:  Turns out that the phrase "herbivorous rage" isn't quite the Google whack you'd think it is. As of this morning there are already <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22herbivorous+rage%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=">319 results</a> (many of which are about the Chronicle's story), including a link spam page regarding "<a href="http://community.westcoastsurfmag.com/_Vicodin-Side-Effects/blog/2018209/2885.html">Vicodin Side Effects</a>."</p>

<p>The more you know!</small></p>
