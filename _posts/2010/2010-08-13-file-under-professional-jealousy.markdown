<p>I loved this little parenthetical bit from Dana Stevens&#39; <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2263790/" target="_self">review of Eat Pray Love in Slate</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(It&#39;s a flaw of both the book and the film that the negotiation of this contract is glossed over so hastily. There&#39;s no shame in having landed a sweet book deal, and having the financial underpinnings of Gilbert&#39;s trip made plain would help to mitigate the audience&#39;s resentment at her barely acknowledged privilege.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously?</p>
