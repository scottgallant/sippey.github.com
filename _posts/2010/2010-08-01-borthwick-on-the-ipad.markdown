<p>Great <a href="http://www.borthwick.com/weblog/2010/07/05/getting-to-know-the-ipad/">in-depth post from John Borthwick</a> on his impressions of the iPad.  I particularly loved the bits about reading apps (Flipboard and the like) and how they&#39;re filling a need created by the overwhelming streaminess of FB and Twitter on the one hand, and the glutted up u/x of websites on the other...</p>

<blockquote><p>Something has to give here — surfing the web works very well on the iPad, the surfing works, the problem is that its the web sites that dont.</p>
<p>The issues embedded in these readers stretch back to the&#0160;beginning&#0160;of the web — all the way back to the&#0160;moment that HTML and then RSS formed a layer, a standard, for the abstraction of underlying data vs. its representation. &#0160; Regardless of your view of the touch based interface its&#0160;undeniable&#0160;that the iPad represents a meaningful shift in how you can view information. &#0160; &#0160;Match that with the insanity of how many web sites look today and you have a rich opportunity for innovation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Worth reading in full.</p>
