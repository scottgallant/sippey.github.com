<p>Not sure if the app is for me, but I really like the demo video for <a href="http://tweetagora.com/" target="_self">Tweet Agora</a>. Fast demo action means this is for power users. &#0160;If you can&#39;t follow along with what&#39;s happening, then this product probably isn&#39;t for you. &#0160;Following lists of Greek gods + references to The Bachelor? Clever.</p>
