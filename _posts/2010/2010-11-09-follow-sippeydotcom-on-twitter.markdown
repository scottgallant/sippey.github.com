<p>If you&#39;ve gone the route of abandoning your feed reader in favor of the Twitter, you can now get every blog post from sippey.com from, you guessed it, <a href="http://twitter.com/sippeydotcom">@sippeydotcom</a>. No blogistential crisis about the distinction between @sippey and @sippeydotcom, just an additional Twitter account, with every post title passed through as a tweet.</p>

<p><small>* Except this one, for recursively obvious reasons.</small></p>
