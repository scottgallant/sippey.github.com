<blockquote><p>For example, music written for contemporary discos, in my opinion, usually ONLY works in those social and physical spaces. Not only that, it works perfectly on their incredible sound systems. It feels stupid to listen to club music at its intended volume at home â€” though people do it. </p></blockquote>

<p>David Byrne&#39;s journal post, which is an extended version of his TED talk this year, is worth reading; it&#39;s a great romp through how music venues have influenced the music that&#39;s created in and for them.  Look forward to seeing this talk in its video context.</p>
