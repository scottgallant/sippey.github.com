<p>The Criterion Collection is having an <a href="http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1366">out of print sale</a>, so go nab <i>Alphaville</i> (or a slew of others) for $5 off.</p>

<blockquote><p>Since we launched the Criterion Collection more than twenty-five years ago, we’ve endeavored to keep everything we’ve published in print. But despite our efforts to renew rights, we are losing a large group of titles from StudioCanal at the end of March, and we wanted to give you advance notice that our editions will be going out of print. ... The titles are going to Lionsgate, and we don’t know when they may be rereleased. As ever, we will continue to try to relicense the films so that they can rejoin the collection sometime in the future.</p></blockquote>
