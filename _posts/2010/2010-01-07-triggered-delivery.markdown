<p>Just got the receipt email for my digital pre-order of Daniel Suarez's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525951571?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=statingtheobviou&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0525951571"><em>Freedom (TM)</em></a> (the follow up to <em>Daemon</em>), which means that as I type this sentence the novel's making its way to my Kindle in the other room. Automatically.</p>

<p>If you've read <em>Daemon</em>, you'll understand the irony in this.</p>
