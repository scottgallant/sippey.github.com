                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;Let&#039;s say that I am someone who is generally very modest but I really want to share an achievement of mine. I tell you: &quot;I hate to brag, but my dissertation defense kicked ass.&quot; I am not lying. I am telling you two truths. One is that I do hate to brag and two is that my dissertation defense went extremely well. The fact that I am in that moment bragging is an exception to a rule (hence my &quot;but-head&quot;). Sure, you can retort, &quot;then don&#039;t [brag]&quot; but, no offense, that would make you a butthead.&quot;</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;For our anguish, they provided us each with a Pie-Oh-My concrete (one part real pumpkin pie, one part vanilla custard, smashed together) and a $10 gift card. Obviously, they should have provided us a lifetime of free Shack Burgers and a wall of remembrance, but we were too humble to suggest anything of that ilk.&quot;</div>
