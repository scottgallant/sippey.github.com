<blockquote><p>We have  learned that when Amazon first submitted <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-reboots-kindle-iphone-app-2009-5">its   Kindle application for the iPhone</a> to Apple, Amazon included its  own  payment system within the app, so customers could just pay for  e-books and download them right  in the app. When Apple spotted the payment system, it told Amazon to get rid of   it, according to a source familiar with Amazon&#39;s  operations. Why? It&#39;s a rule Apple smartly instituted at the App Store&#39;s  beginning, forbidding third-party e-commerce of digital goods within  apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>&quot;So, um, George. We know you&#39;ve spent the last four weeks learning Cocoa Touch and building that really nice, seamless book shopping experience within the app, taking advantage of the payments API, connecting to user&#39;s Amazon accounts and all that.  It really was a nice piece of work.  But we&#39;re gonna have to rip it out. Instead, can you just do a little button in the top right of the home screen that launches Mobile Safari?  OK, thanks.&quot;</p>
