<p>Drew Hoolhorst nails the feeling in The City* this week in his <a href="http://www.rocket-shoes.com/a-love-letter-to-the-san-francisco-giants/">love letter to the San Francisco Giants</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s legitimately a magical time in San Francisco right now. I have the fortune of working approximately two blocks away from AT&amp;T/”For Christsakes, it’s PacBell” Park, and it’s been absolutely surreal. If a unicorn came around the corner and high fived me right now and said, “Go Giants”, I wouldn’t even take an earbud out. I’d just high hoove him right back and point and smile.</p></blockquote>
