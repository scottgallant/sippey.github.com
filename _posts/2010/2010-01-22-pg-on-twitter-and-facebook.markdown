<p>Great post from David Hornik <a href="http://ventureblog.com/articles/2010/01/facebook_twitter_and_pg.php">at VentureBlog</a> after spending time with Procter &amp; Gamble at their "Innovation Outreach Venturing Day."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To P&amp;G, Twitter is a great broadcast medium -- it is best for one to many communications that are short bursts of timely information -- but as good as it is for timely information, the P&amp;G folks do not view it as particularly relevant to what they are doing on the brand building and advertising side. For those things that Proctor &amp; Gamble thinks are most interesting and important, they do not believe that Twitter will ever approach the value they can get out of a Google or Facebook.</p>

<p>Worth reading in full.</p>
