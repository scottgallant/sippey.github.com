<p>Recommended:  today's <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122526723">Fresh Air interview with producer T-Bone Burnett</a>, especially the bit about 45 minutes into the show where Burnett describes the process of recording with Roy Orbison. Orbison wouldn't wear headphones in the studio because he didn't need to hear his own voice in the mix; he had spent so much time on the road without a monitor mix that he didn't need to hear his own voice over the band...he could tell if he was singing on pitch <em>based on the vibrations in his jaw</em>.</p>
