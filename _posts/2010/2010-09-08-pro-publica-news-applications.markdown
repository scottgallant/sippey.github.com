<p><a href="http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/welcome-to-the-nerd-blog">Pro Publica launches their nerd blog</a>, which is where they'll talk about the "news applications" they're building.  Which is great and all, but what's fantastic about this is their simple definition of a news application.  "Itâ€™s an interactive web page that uses software instead of words and pictures to do journalism." Nice.</p>
