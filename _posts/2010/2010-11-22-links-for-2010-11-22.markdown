                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;Without a conductor, this train ride is going to end in a fiery crash of discontent. I&#039;m not telling people to get off; I&#039;m just letting you know that if you stay on, you&#039;ll be a passenger on a train running on the fumes of irrational hope and unfulfilled promise. If you insist on riding it for the rest of the season, I highly recommend you stay firmly ensconced in the bar car.&quot;</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;For Murdoch, I have to imagine there is also something personal about this project. Iâ€™m sure he is furious that he has so far failed to extend his record of success and dominance, unbroken in other media, into the digital world.&quot;</div>
