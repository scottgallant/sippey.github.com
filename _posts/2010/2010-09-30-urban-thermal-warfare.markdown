<p>This is the best thing I&#39;ve read all day; <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/las-vegas-death-ray.html" target="_self">BLDGBLOG</a> on the plastic-melting parabolic reflector that is the Vdara Hotel, aka the <a href="http://www.lvrj.com/news/vdara-visitor---death-ray--scorched-hair-103777559.html" target="_self">Las Vegas death ray</a>:</p>
