<p>I would have loved to follow Mike Monteiro at <a href="http://twitter.com/1stfans">@1stfans</a>.  I sent you a follow request!  I would have paid the $20! You had a hot lead attached to a Twitter handle...but you never followed up to ask me for my money.</p>

<p>Oh well!  Looking forward to reading all of those tweets for free when he posts them to his <a href="http://mikemonteiro.tumblr.com">blog</a>.</p>
