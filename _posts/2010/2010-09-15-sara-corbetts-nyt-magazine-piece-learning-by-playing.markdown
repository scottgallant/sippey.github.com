<p>This weekend&#39;s NY Times Magazine features Sara Corbett&#39;s piece on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/magazine/19video-t.html?pagewanted=all">transforming education through game mechanics</a>. (It&#39;s now up in preview on NYTimes.com.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Once it has been worked over by game designers, a lesson doesn’t look like a lesson anymore. It is now a quest. And while students at the school are put through the usual rigors of studying pre-algebra, basic physics, ancient civilizations and writing, they do it inside interdisciplinary classes with names like Codeworlds — a hybrid of math and English class — where the quests blend skills from different subject areas. Students have been called upon to balance the budget and brainstorm business ideas for an imaginary community called Creepytown, for example, and to design architectural blueprints for a village of bumbling little creatures called the Troggles. There are elements of the school’s curriculum that look familiar — nightly independent reading assignments, weekly reading-comprehension packets and plenty of work with pencils and paper — and others that don’t. Quest to Learn students record podcasts, film and edit videos, play video games, blog avidly and occasionally receive video messages from aliens.</p></blockquote>

<p>Can&#39;t wait to dig into this.</p>
