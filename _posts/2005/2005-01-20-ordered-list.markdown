<p>With apologies in advance to the inimitable <a href="http://5ives.com/">Merlin Mann</a>, five things I've yet to tire of, after all these years...</p>

<ol><li>Discussions of the <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/01/19/the_social_impa">pros</a> and <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2005/01/20/let_no_fellow_nofollow_lest_we_all_lie_fallow.html">cons</a> of <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">various ways</a> to combat <a href="http://sixapart.com/pronet/comment_spam.html">unwanted messaging</a>.</li>

<li>The guitar sound in The Breeders' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002HDG/statingtheobvioua/"><em>Cannonball</em></a>.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.tadalist.com/">To do lists</a>.</li>

<li>The lip-smackingly-close way that Carl Kasell is miked on NPR in the mornings.&nbsp; You can hear.&nbsp; Every.&nbsp; Syllable.&nbsp; Dis.&nbsp; Tinct.&nbsp; Ly.</li>

<li>New devices.&nbsp; You'd think I'd be over that by now.&nbsp; You'd be wrong.</li></ol>

<p>More soon, patient reader. This site's place in your favorites list, your My Yahoo prefs, or your fully synchronized OPML-driven info-cloud aware self-organizing attention management system <em>is</em> appreciated.</p>
