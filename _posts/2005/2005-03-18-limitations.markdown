<p>I didn't realize it until very recently, but my iPod had been stressing me out.&nbsp; Every time I stuck the phones in my ears, powered up the device and scrolled through my tracks I had a <em>decision</em> to make.&nbsp; What genre?&nbsp; What artist?&nbsp; What album?&nbsp; Or should I pick a playlist?&nbsp; Or just shuffle everything?&nbsp; Or shuffle a genre?&nbsp; Or an artist?&nbsp; Should I shuffle my albums?&nbsp; By the time I had made up my mind, I'd be half way through my commute, and then spend the other half wondering if I had made the right choice.</p>

<p>My iPod was giving me option anxiety.&nbsp; <em>(Woe is me.)</em></p>

<p>I didn't realize this until I picked up a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">Shuffle</a> on Monday.&nbsp; It hasn't left my shirt pocket since.&nbsp; Not only is it <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/01/shuffling_light.html">ridiculously light</a>, but the Shuffle's insanely simple product design has turned the &quot;what to listen to?&quot; decision into a simple yes/no: to listen or not to listen.&nbsp; If yes, then jam the headphones into ears and push Play.&nbsp; That's it.</p>



<p>Well, that's not only it, of course.&nbsp; The iTunes <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/shuffle.html">Autofill</a> feature gives the user control over what music ends up in their pocket (pick from this genre, from this playlist, etc.) while staying true to the gestalt of the device.&nbsp; It's this combination of streamlined industrial design and sophisticated software design that makes the Shuffle such a fantastic product.&nbsp; Apple made the most important use case (&quot;listen to music&quot;) <em>a complete no-brainer</em>, and then backed it up with elegant way for the user to shape their day-to-day experience of that use case.</p>
