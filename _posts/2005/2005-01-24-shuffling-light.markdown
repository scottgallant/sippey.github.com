<p>Having spent all of about ten minutes in an Apple store over the weekend (exiting quickly to avoid the temptation to buy a Mini), I've come to the conclusion that the most interesting thing about the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">Shuffle</a> isn't its lack of screen, or its &quot;pull tracks at random from iTunes&quot; feature, or its price point or its button placement.&nbsp; The most interesting thing is just how <em>light</em> it is.&nbsp; With other Apple products there's the familiar heft -- their relative density (combined with superior industrial design chops) make their products just &quot;feel right&quot; in the hand.</p>

<p>But the Shuffle is something else entirely.&nbsp; It's light enough to be remarkably light.&nbsp; Ridiculously light, even.&nbsp; So light as to truly deserve the &quot;wearable&quot; label.&nbsp; Which is why I'm surprised they're shipping with a lanyard instead of some sort of integrated clip (like some other flash-based music players).&nbsp; Lanyards would be great if headphones were wireless; otherwise you end up being a mess of cabling.&nbsp; A clip would be perfect -- clip it to your shirt, your pocket, your bag strap, your coat collar, your <em>tie</em> even.</p>
