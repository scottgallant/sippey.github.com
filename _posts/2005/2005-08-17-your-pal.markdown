<p>I know I must stop this nostalgicizing (I'm absolutely <em>sure</em> that's a word, dagummit), but many thanks to Sir Owen Thomas for the pointer to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=suckcom">suckcom</a>, the syndicated account on LJ that's retreading suck.com, nine years later.&nbsp; If suckcom were your <del>pal</del> friend, you'd be having serendipitous moments like this one:&nbsp; seeing that nine years ago Stewart Brand was the <a href="http://suck.com/netmoguls/96/08/16/front.html">netmogul card</a>, and then reading that <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-5835759.html">The Well's up for sale</a>!<br /></p>
