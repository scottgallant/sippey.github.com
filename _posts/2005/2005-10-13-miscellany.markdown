<p>Odds and ends.</p>

<ul><li>I must have some kind of reputation for being an insatiable gadget person.&nbsp; I have no idea where people could have gotten that idea, but no, I'm not rushing out to buy a video iPod.&nbsp; Who wants to pay $1.99 for music videos?&nbsp; And besides, I just got a Nano for my birthday.&nbsp; It's so <em>thin</em>...</li>

<li>Top three moments of Web 2.0, for me:&nbsp; Mary Meeker's High Order Bit (40 some-odd slides in 15 minutes, how can you beat that?&nbsp; You can't.), Mena's description of LiveJournal, and the teen panel where the girl from UC Berkeley was clearly flirting with the surfer boy with the deep voice.</li>

<li>I'm a bit worried that once again there are t-shirts commemorating <em>parties</em>.&nbsp; &quot;Hey!&nbsp; Let's tempt fate!&quot;&nbsp; Jesus, people, don't wake the bear, he's <em>resting</em>.</li>

<li>Bloglines now has keyboard shortcuts, and there was much rejoicing.&nbsp; Apps that encourage information consumption should afford speed reading.</li>

<li>Lost.&nbsp; You're watching this, right?&nbsp; Where the hell did Desmond run off to?&nbsp; And why does the bunker have a brand new washer/dryer set, while everything else seems to be from 1980?&nbsp; And, more importantly, is this story Locke's or Jack's?</li>

<li>I've been trying to read fiction again.&nbsp; Recently knocked back <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375406778/">No Country for Old Men</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060529709/">Everything is Illuminated</a>, both worth reading (despite what Caterina <a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/000851.html">said</a>).&nbsp; I'm about 1/7th of the way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312424442/">I Am Charlotte Simmons</a>, but fully expect to get about half-way through and then throw the book across the room like I've done with every other Wolfe book I've read.&nbsp; would love to be proven wrong.</li>

<li>What I really want to read, though, is Peter Morville's book, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ambient/index.html">Ambient Findability</a>.&nbsp; I mean, how much more Web 2.0 could you be?&nbsp; Actually, if I could read that while wearing one of those t-shirts, I'd be <em>set</em>.</li></ul>

<p>Here endeth the bullets.&nbsp; </p>
