<p>Kottke digests some interesting notes about Spotlight and the coming tools in OS X to denote relationships between two objects in the OS (<em>this</em> invoice is related to <em>this</em> PSD file).&nbsp; Being a recovering <a href="http://www.thebrain.com">Brain</a> user, I have to wonder just how Apple will handle the task of presenting those relationships.&nbsp; And, assuming that they make those relationships discoverable, what kind of apps get built to browse that data.</p>
