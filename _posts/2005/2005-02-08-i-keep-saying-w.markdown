<p>Google Maps -- making <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=berkeley%20ca%20to%20clayton%20mo&amp;spn=23.937500%2C39.486495">driving directions</a> actually <em>fun</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(Just wait until they enable an overlay of satellite imagery from <a href="http://www.keyhole.com/">Keyhole</a> with one click.&nbsp; Then someone will write a bookmarklet-y thing to transition from a zoomed-in Google map to an Amazon street-level photoset.&nbsp; And then we'll never have to leave the house -- we'll just buy huge monitors and pretend we can fly around the country like Chris Reeves did in <em>Superman</em>.)</p>
