<p>So a friend mentioned in passing today that she's about to take a trip to L.A., and that one of her destinations is <a href="http://www.mjt.org/">The Museum of Jurassic Technology</a>.&nbsp; (Which, if you've never been to, you need to visit.&nbsp; Don't ask questions, just go.)&nbsp; Since there was connectivity and a browser at hand, the conversation led to a quick visit to the MJT's website.&nbsp; And that led, naturally, to their online museum shop, which is chock full of great products like <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/museumjt/eyeofnevire.html">The Eye of the Needle View-Master Reel</a> and <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/museumjt/pedestal.html">The Cone of Obliscence Pedestal</a>.&nbsp; (Ahhh, if only they resold such goods through Amazon, then I could add them to my wishlist.)</p>

<p>Fans of the museum will relish the fact that the &quot;recommended books&quot; section of the gift shop is naturally missing <span class="sans"><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679764895/statingtheobvioua/">Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder</a></em> (subtitled &quot;Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology,&quot; and should be read only <em>after</em> a pilgrimage to Culver City).</span></p>
