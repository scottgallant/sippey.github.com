<p>Thirteen years ago, on a Sunday morning in October, Trina and I piled into her car and took a drive down I-5 from San Francisco to the Grapevine to walk amongst <a href="http://www.tedsimages.com/text/umbrella.htm">Christo's umbrellas</a>.&nbsp; They were unabashedly beautiful -- bright yellow splahses of color in the brown California hills.&nbsp; While it's great to see all the pics of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/christo/">Central Park gates</a>, there's nothing like seeing a Christo piece in person.</p>

<p>But the umbrellas were no match for what we saw on the way home.&nbsp; After five hours down and five hours back, we were driving along 580 towards the Bay Bridge when we both saw it at the same time -- a massive, red glow from the hills to the east.&nbsp; &quot;My God,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;<a href="http://www.sfmuseum.org/oakfire/overview.html">Oakland's on fire</a>.&quot;</p>
