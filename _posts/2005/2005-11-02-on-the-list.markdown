<p>Unordered lists are lame.&nbsp; So let's try an ordered list this time!</p>

<ol><li><a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/10/31/we_got_married">Anil's post on getting married</a>.&nbsp; I'm not really a Dr. Phil kinda guy, but this was one of the best things I've ever read on the nature of marriage.&nbsp; And the guy's only been married about four days.&nbsp; Damned overachiever.</li>

<li><a href="http://btrott.typepad.com/">Ben's blog</a>.&nbsp; The guy can write, too?&nbsp; Damned overachiever.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006EXLQ/statingtheobviou">Frou Frou</a>.&nbsp; Guilty pleasure right now -- bleeps and bloops and melodies from a pretty voice.</li>

<li>The fact that I still haven't thrown <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312424442/statingtheobviou">Charlotte Simmons</a></em> across the room. Even though in the space of about 20 pages Charlotte went from being a hillbilly prude to getting felt up by the senior boy from the frat house.&nbsp; Huh?</li>

<li>The Pan Pacific Wontons at <a href="http://eastbay.citysearch.com/profile/1032418/">Kirin Restaurant</a> on Solano Avenue in Berkeley.&nbsp; Thank God they're right around the corner from my house.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.seasaltrestaurant.com/">Sea Salt</a>, a new-ish restaurant on San Pablo in Berkeley.&nbsp; The first restaurant in a while where we walked out and immediate said &quot;we need to go back to try more stuff on the menu.&quot;&nbsp; The fact that we sat at the kitchen counter and watched dishes being plated probably contributed to that.</li></ol>

<p>Next time, its back to bullets.&nbsp; This ordered list thing implies more meaning than intended.</p>
