<p>Great quote in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/11/491780.aspx#492338">comments</a> of a post by Raymond Chen @ Microsoft about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/11/491780.aspx">his attempts to simplify his office layout</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The older I get, the more I realize my best tool is my trash can.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I still have about 40 boxes of books in my garage that I've yet to move into our house, three years on.&nbsp; On sum, I bet I've actively thought about three boxes worth.&nbsp; I'm seriously tempted to sell or donate the rest of them.&nbsp; Who needs all those books?<br /></p>
