<p>James Hong, infamous creator of HOTorNOT (seen last night in the Daily Show's writer's credit skit), appears to have done it again:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.savemyass.com/">savemyass.com</a>, &quot;a personal assistant that keeps your girlfriend or wife happy by sending her flowers on your behalf, on a regular but semi-random basis.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>The inspired feature is the <a href="http://savemyass.com/public/tour" title="scroll to the bottom of the page">Panic Button</a>, where you can indicate to the system just how bad your situation is...the screenshot shows &quot;she's throwing things&quot; as being pretty far to one end of the spectrum.</p>
