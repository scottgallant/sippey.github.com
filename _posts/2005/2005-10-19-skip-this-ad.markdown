<p>Dear NYTimes.com,</p>

<p>Purely on faith, I ponied up for a year of <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/">Times Select</a>.&nbsp; While you actually figure out what the product is beyond Tom Friedman, the least you could do for subscribers is kill the interstital ads when clicking from an external site to an individual story.&nbsp; Please?</p>

<p>Sharing is caring,<br />Michael</p>
