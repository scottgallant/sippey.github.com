<p>Jason Levine posts a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/queso/sets/592302/">great little photoset</a> of the otherwise deadly boring act of migrating files off an old computer...except this time the old computer is a PowerBook Duo 230.&nbsp; Has to be one of my all time favorite machines; I used one for a couple of years -- well after its prime -- and wrote my most <em>(um, only? --ed.)</em> productive two years of Obvious pieces on it...&nbsp; I recognize the ridiculousness of professing love for a hunk of plastic, metal and glass...but I <em>loved</em> that machine.</p>

<p>(Oh, and I wanted to leave the nostalgia category alone with its sole <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/nostalgia/index.html">black holes </a>post, but I just couldn't file this one anywhere else, now could I.)</p>
