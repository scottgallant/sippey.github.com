<p>Spotted this morning in North Berkeley, a late model Volvo sedan with the license plate <strong>DRM CEKR</strong>.&nbsp; Which rivals the previously spotted-in-Berkeley <strong>SNDMAIL</strong> (Eric Allman, perhaps?), and the spotted-in-San-Mateo <strong>DRWXRWX </strong>(where I'm assuming the lack of permissions for others is implied).</p>
