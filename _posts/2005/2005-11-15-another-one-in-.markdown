<p>OK, I'll get this one in under the wire too, before tonight's episode of the The Office.&nbsp; I know there are plenty of purists out there who will claim that the NBC version will never be as funny as the original&nbsp; from the BBC, but I beg to disagree.&nbsp; Steve Carrell is pitch perfect as Michael, the ongoing storyline of the office romance is sweet without coming anywhere near treacle, and they're doing a great job of adapting for the US audience.</p>

<p>Case in point -- the show's obsession with Chili's.&nbsp; Not only is it plot appropriate (&quot;Inc. Magazine wrote that Chili's is the businessman's new golf course.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Well, not yet.&nbsp; I'm writing a letter to the editor.&quot; <em>Excuse the extreme paraphrasing --ed.</em>), but last week's episode had Carrell and Tim Meadows doing a brief duet of the &quot;Baby Back Ribs&quot; song.&nbsp; Product placement doesn't get any better than that, folks.</p>
