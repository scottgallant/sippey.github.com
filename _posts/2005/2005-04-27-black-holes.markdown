<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/04/a-whole-new-internet">black holes</a>, I'm coming up on ten years of <a href="http://theobvious.com/archive/">Stating the Obvious</a> (dead, dying, nearly buried -- don't even bother clicking, there's nothing there to see; instead, do me a favor and just imagine Jeremy Piven (yes, that's his name) in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1558908382/statingtheobviouA/">Grosse Pointe Blank</a></em> yelling &quot;Ten years!&nbsp; Ten years, man!&quot;).&nbsp; No need to celebrate; the thing should have been buried back in about 1999, after I gave up the thrice-weekly schedule for the thrice-quarterly schedule, which slipped into the thrice-yearly schedule.</p>

<p>Anyway, where was I.&nbsp; Black holes.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Well, since it's been ten years for theobvious, that means it was about nine years ago that I wrote a few pieces for the oft-missed <a href="http://www.suck.com/">Suck</a>, under the editorial guidance of <a href="http://www.freedonia.com/~carl/">former</a> and <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/">current</a> microstars.&nbsp; And believe it or not, one of those pieces, <em><a href="http://www.suck.com/zerobaud/96/08/01/content.html">An Astral Theory of Rock</a></em>, actually had something to do with black holes!&nbsp; And rock stars.&nbsp; And rock stars that turned into black holes.&nbsp; Here's a brief excerpt: </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;"><p>If the [rock] star is sufficiently massive, it will collapse into a Black Hole.&nbsp; The rocket scientists among us will&nbsp; immediately recognize the KISS revival tour as the largest black hole the industry has ever seen. In the center of the black hole lies the singularity (Gene Simmons's&nbsp; tongue), where matter is crushed to infinite density, and the curvature of spacetime is extreme. Which explains why millions of people keep&nbsp; expecting to hear &quot;Beth&quot; on the&nbsp; radio, and to be reunited with their&nbsp; 7th-grade car pools.</p></blockquote><p>There's more after that...and plenty before it as well.&nbsp; (Remember, it was the mid-nineties, back when writing on the web actually meant stringing <em>multiple paragraphs</em> together -- good times.)&nbsp; But hey, if the analogy fits, right?&nbsp; And since my fine friend Jason seems to think that <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">some of us</a> have disappeared into a &quot;blackhole for creative people,&quot; that must mean it's time to dust off the old standards, get the <a href="http://www.0sil8.com/">band</a> <a href="http://www.eod.com/">back</a> <a href="http://so.anyway.org/">together</a>, and kick off our Internet <a href="http://theobvious.com/wired/">revival tour</a> with <a href="http://www.bianca.com/">a rousing</a> <a href="http://www.regarding.com/" title="we did podcasting before there were pods.  or casting.  discuss.">rendition</a> of &quot;Those Were the Days.&quot;</p>

<p>And hey!&nbsp; We don't need the big concert promoters -- we'll raise tour bus funds with <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/">Dropcash</a>, plan the logistics with <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>, list the dates on <a href="http://www.upcoming.org/">Upcoming</a>, distribute nightly direct-from-the-board ogg's as cc-licensed <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">torrents</a>, blog about it on <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a>, and afterwards sell the commemorative photo album through <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a>.&nbsp; It'll be great!</p>

<p>Just after I figure out this whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">quantum tunneling</a> thing.</p>
