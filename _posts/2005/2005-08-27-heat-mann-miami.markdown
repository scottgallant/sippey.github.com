<p>Via <a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/">Matt Jones</a>' <a href="http://del.icio.us/blackbeltjones#2005-08-26">delicious feed</a>, a <a href="http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/006244.html">great analysis</a> by K-Punk of Michael Mann's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/"><em>Heat</em></a>, ten years on.</p><blockquote><p>This is a post-Fordist organized crime movie, in which the scores are
undertaken by crews, not Families, in an LA of polished chrome and
interchangable designer kitchens, of featureless freeways and
late-night diners, a no-place that is very far from being a utopia. All
the local colour, the cuisine aromas, the cultural idiolects which the
obvious comparison pieces, the Coppola and Scorsese gangster flicks of
the seventies*, depended upon, have been leeched out, painted over,
re-fitted and re-modelled. You could be anywhere ... It is a world
without landmarks. Ours: a branded Sprawl, where markable territory has
been replaced by endlessly repeating vistas of replicating franchises.
The ghosts of Old Europe that stalked Scorsese and Coppola's streets
have been exorcised, buried with the ancient beefs, bad blood and
burning vendettas somewhere beneath the multinational coffee shops.</p></blockquote><p>OK, maybe a bit overblown (a movie can be post-Fordist?), but still.&nbsp; <em>Heat</em> is a recent classic, much better than Mann's more recent ode to L.A., the Cruise-infected <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0369339/"><em>Collateral</em></a>.&nbsp; Given his comparisons to Scorsese and Coppola flicks, I'm surprised Mr. Punk missed the fact that <em>Heat</em> was the first movie where DeNiro and Pacino actually had a scene together.&nbsp; (They were both in <em>The Godfather: Part II</em>, of course, but Puzo's novel lacked the necessary time travel element to enable shared screentime.)&nbsp; The <em>Heat</em> diner scene between oh-so-similar cop and robber is one of the highlights of the movie (enhanced, of course, by the inside baseball feeling of it all); the other is the ferocious 25 minute bank robbery / gun battle, which Just. Won't.&nbsp; Stop.</p>

<p>And speaking of gun battles, according to IMDB Mann's currently filming a theatrical <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0430357/"><em>Miami Vice</em></a>, with Jamie Foxx as Tubbs, and Colin Farrell as Crockett.&nbsp; Hot damn, I love America.</p>
