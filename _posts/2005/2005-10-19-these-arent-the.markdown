<p>Sometimes, crowds aren't so wise.&nbsp; Case in point, <a href="http://www.tagyu.com/">tagyu.com</a>, which is learning from what other people have written to make tag recommendations on user-supplied content.&nbsp; It works if you're writing about things that geeks are writing about...but that's about it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Case in point. Input:&nbsp; &quot;On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree.&quot;&nbsp; Output:&nbsp; &quot;php programming pear.&quot;&nbsp; I'm not necessarily knocking the concept or the implementation -- other than to note that this will have limited utility until there's a broader corpus of tagged content.&nbsp; And tags today are the realm of early adopters...like people who have a high likelihood of using the words &quot;pear&quot; and &quot;php&quot; near each other.&nbsp; Will be interesting to track this over time...six months from now (and after a holiday tagging season), has the output for that pear-tree situated partridge changed?<br /></p>
