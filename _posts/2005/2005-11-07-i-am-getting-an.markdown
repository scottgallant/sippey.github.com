<p>More proof that this blog is more for me than it is for you, an update on my <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/10/concordances.html">quest</a> to finish&nbsp; <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374281580/002-3672690-8520057?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;me=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;no=283155&amp;st=books">I Am Charlotte Simmons</a></em> without throwing it across the room.&nbsp; Warning:&nbsp; spoilers.</p>

<p>First, am I completely insane, or is the major conflict in the novel turning out to not involve the protagonist at all?&nbsp; 700+ pages of drama, all leading up to a show down over academic integrity between a basketball player and a self-important, bookish freak?&nbsp; Wolfe better bring Charlotte into the middle of this conflict in the last 100 pages, or I'm gonna be <em>pissed</em>.</p>

<p>Second, if that drama doesn't involve Charlotte in some significant way, that means that the entire story arc of the novel hinges on a drunken first time?&nbsp; If so, that's insane.&nbsp; Wolfe didn't spend enough time in the front two-thirds of the book setting up Charlotte's character to have that scene have as much of an impact as it is...turning her into a mute on Christmas break, and a blubbering idiot when she returns to school.&nbsp; She is Charlotte Simmons!&nbsp; Isn't she?</p>

<p>Finally, I have a feeling that he's going to try to pull all of this together in the last part of the book with the &quot;governor of California&quot; plotline that's been lying around since Chapter 1.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it's just been lying around, not going anywhere.&nbsp; There's just no room in that part of the story for any flexibility:&nbsp; if that becomes the lynch pin of the book (bringing Hoyt, Vance, Adam, Jojo and Charlotte together into some paroxysm of plot), it just won't hold.</p>

<p>I'm still gonna finish the damn thing.&nbsp; Just so when I get to the <em>end</em> of the book, I can throw it across the room.<br /> </p>
