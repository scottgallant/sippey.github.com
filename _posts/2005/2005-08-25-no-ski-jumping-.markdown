<p>What a drag.&nbsp; I was looking forward to all the local news coverage of the <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/08/ski_jumping_rio.html">aforementioned ski jump</a> on the Fillmore Street hill this weekend, but alas -- <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/25/BAG9GECF4P32.DTL">it's been postponed</a>.&nbsp; And pity Johnny Moseley, he'll need to find another way to celebrate his 30th.</p>
