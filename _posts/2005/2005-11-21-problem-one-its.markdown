<p>So folks are all a-twitter with the announcement that Tivo to Go will allow you to push your shows to your video iPod.&nbsp; Whee.&nbsp; But my GOD, has anyone actually used Tivo to Go?&nbsp; Or, more to the point, is anyone actually using it <em>on a regular basis?</em>&nbsp; May Wong of the Associated Press <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051121/ap_on_hi_te/tivotogo_expands;_ylt=AjU6qA.dgtYzfnFtkjTTadqs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3cjE0b2MwBHNlYwM3Mzg-">nails the TTG problem</a> on the head...</p><blockquote><p>Don't expect instant gratification: The transfer process from a TiVo
Series2 set-top-box to a PC — a necessary step before syncing to a
portable — occurs roughly in real-time. An hour-long show will take an
hour to transfer to the PC, then roughly another 10 minutes or so to
sync to a portable device.</p></blockquote><p>So, it takes more time to transfer a show to your portable device than it does to actually watch the show.&nbsp; You can thank a crippled USB (1.0?) port on the Tivo device for this.&nbsp; I'm sure wily Tivo hackers have figured a way around this problem, but for your average person who just Wants Things to Work, this doesn't cut it.</p>
