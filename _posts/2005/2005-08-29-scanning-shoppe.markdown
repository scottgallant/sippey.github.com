<p>The Container Store looks like they're doing something interesting in their Manhattan store:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/goshop/index.jhtml" title="GoShop! Scan &amp; Deliver">GoShop! Scan &amp; Deliver</a>.</p><blockquote><p>You just shop, scan and go! You don't have to push a shopping cart around, you'll enjoy faster checkout and you don't have to haul your purchases home.&nbsp; It will all be delivered to you anywhere in Manhattan -- the same day if you'd like -- for just $15.</p></blockquote><p>Potential upside:&nbsp; lighter psychological burden of lugging things around the store could lead to higher average tickets (I scan it, it's mine); home delivery means high cost real estate could be better used for merchandising, and shift delivery-bound inventory to lower cost warehouse space.&nbsp; Potential downside:&nbsp; customer education and real time tech support.&nbsp; Trap to avoid:&nbsp; merchandising in the scanner itself; the customer's already in a rich retail environment, don't annoy them with &quot;you may also be interested in...&quot; messages and make them read the screen more than they have to.</p>
