<p>Via <a href="http://sociate.com/blog/archives/2005_12_01_archive.html#113570566521282244">Sociate</a>, an excellent post from Sean Savage proposing <a href="http://www.cheesebikini.com/208/archives/000978.html">a typology of human social networks</a> (HSNs).&nbsp; Forget the usual friendsterisms; instead he presents POVs on HSNs from machines, corporations and memes.&nbsp; Context is indeed everything.<br /></p>
