<p>I can't tell you how disappointed I am that a search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?biw=1024&amp;hl=en&amp;q=wifi+%22disco+ball%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search"><em>wifi &quot;disco ball&quot;</em></a> doesn't have anything from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">boingboing.net</a> in its first few pages of results.&nbsp; You'd think that such a device (which would be a fantastic addition to any workspace) would be right up their alley.</p>
