<p>A friend just pointed me to a feature I hadn't seen on Amazon:&nbsp; concordances.&nbsp; They're pulling the most frequently used 100 words, and displaying them like a tag cloud.&nbsp; Here are the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/sitb-next/0312424442/ref=sbx_con/104-9555762-4143111?%5Fencoding=UTF8#concordance">top 100 for <em>I Am Charlotte Simmons</em></a>, the new Tom Wolfe book that I've yet to <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/10/miscellany.html">throw across the room</a>.</p><blockquote><p>adam&nbsp; again&nbsp; am&nbsp; another&nbsp; anything&nbsp; arms&nbsp; away&nbsp; bed&nbsp; beverly&nbsp; big&nbsp; black&nbsp; boys&nbsp; came&nbsp; charlotte&nbsp; coach&nbsp; come&nbsp; daddy&nbsp; door&nbsp; down&nbsp; dupont&nbsp; enough&nbsp; even&nbsp; ever&nbsp; everybody&nbsp; eyes&nbsp; face&nbsp; fact&nbsp; felt&nbsp; first&nbsp; front&nbsp; fuck&nbsp; fucking&nbsp; gave&nbsp; get&nbsp; girl&nbsp; go&nbsp; going&nbsp; good&nbsp; got&nbsp; great&nbsp; guy&nbsp; hand&nbsp; head&nbsp; herself&nbsp; himself&nbsp; hoyt&nbsp; jojo&nbsp; knew&nbsp; know&nbsp; let&nbsp; lie&nbsp; little&nbsp; long&nbsp; look&nbsp; looked&nbsp; looking&nbsp; man&nbsp; mean&nbsp; moment&nbsp; momma&nbsp; mr&nbsp; night&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; now&nbsp; oh&nbsp; people&nbsp; put&nbsp; really&nbsp; right&nbsp; room&nbsp; say&nbsp; saying&nbsp; see&nbsp; seemed&nbsp; shit&nbsp; side&nbsp; simmons&nbsp; smile&nbsp; something&nbsp; still&nbsp; students&nbsp; take&nbsp; tell&nbsp; thing&nbsp; think&nbsp; thought&nbsp; three&nbsp; time&nbsp; tip&nbsp; took&nbsp; toward&nbsp; turned&nbsp; two&nbsp; vance&nbsp; voice&nbsp; want&nbsp; wanted&nbsp; went&nbsp; white&nbsp; word </p></blockquote><p>NB:&nbsp; Both &quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;fucking&quot; made it into the top 100.&nbsp; Nothing against those words, mind you, it's just a pointer that Wolfe may be trying a <em>bit</em> too hard. As usual.<br /></p>
