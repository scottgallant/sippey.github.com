<p>So as anyone within earshot of me knows, we've been on the grand tour of grade schools for the last couple of months, looking at the public and &quot;independent&quot; schools in our (extended) neighborhood. I could (and do!) go on for hours about what we've been seeing and learning, but that would bore you to tears. Instead, I'll share with you the results of a little between-classroom brainstorming about how office life could learn a little bit from <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/moblog/2005/11/kindergarten_to.html">grade school life</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So, in no particular order, here are some ideas for how to run your next <a href="http://msippey.tadalist.com/lists/public/155420">Web 2.0</a> startup:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Forget calendars, try periods!</strong>&nbsp; Every period is 50 minutes, with a 10 minute break in between.&nbsp; &quot;What are you doing 4th period?&nbsp; Wanna get together to talk about our alpha invite strategy?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I have a yellow fade discussion then.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;How about 5th period?&quot; &quot;Sounds good.&quot;&nbsp; Make a rule that no meeting can span two periods without a good reason, and why not actually ring a bell at the start and end of each period. </li>

<li><strong>Cubbies!</strong>&nbsp; Everyone needs somewhere to hang their coat and stash their lunch box.</li>

<li><strong>Lots of wall art!</strong>&nbsp; The best thing about grade school classrooms are the walls -- they're covered with great stuff!&nbsp; Charts of the alphabet or the periodic table, ground rules about about classroom behavior, plus lots and lots of stuff produced by the kids.&nbsp; Artifacts everywhere, and in color!</li>

<li><strong>Specialists and counselors!</strong>&nbsp; Find the equivalent of the &quot;wacky art teacher&quot; or the &quot;geeky person who runs the computer lab&quot; for your business, and make sure to have outsiders on retainer who can help manage your equivalent of the ADHD kids.</li>

<li><strong>Morning meeting!</strong>&nbsp; In high school we called it home room -- use it to take attendance, lay out the daily schedule and talk about what's happening at home.</li>

<li><strong>Nap area!</strong>&nbsp; Of course.</li>

<li><strong>Snack time!</strong>&nbsp; Juice, graham crackers or even the occasional quesadilla on a hot plate, which turns an everyday snack into a project!</li>

<li><strong>PE!</strong>&nbsp; Whether it's frisbee, yoga, spinning, volleyball, kickball or dodgeball, everyone needs to get their ya-ya's out.&nbsp; You may even consider requiring a note from a doctor to skip it.&nbsp; Up to you.</li>

<li><strong>Child of the week!</strong>&nbsp; Everyone needs to feel special; put their name on the board, let them present their latest and pick their favorite snack.</li>

<li><strong>Field trips!</strong>&nbsp; Everyone needs to get out and see the big bad world...whether it's market research, a trip to the local geek museum or even the bar down the street.&nbsp; After all, what would you rather go on -- a strategic planning offsite, or a field trip!</li></ul>

<p>The list could go on and on; you get the gist.&nbsp; The benefits could be huge -- employee satisfaction goes up, it's a hook for recruiting young talent, and even the grizzled veterans get to feel like kids again.</p>
