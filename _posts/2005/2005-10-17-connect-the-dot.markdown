<p>Exhibit one:&nbsp; Anil on <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/10/17/the_flip_2k5">The Flip 2k5</a>, or &quot;Yahoo bought everyone on my buddy list, and all I got was this t-shirt.&quot; [1]&nbsp; Exhibit two:&nbsp; nine years ago in Suck, <a href="http://suck.com/pitch/96/10/15/">the pitch for wordprocessor.com</a>.[2]&nbsp; Connecting the dots is an exercise left to the reader.[3]</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp; Note to self:&nbsp; more charts, less talk.<br />[2]&nbsp; I've said it before, and I'll say it again:&nbsp; it's wonderful to have <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/suckcom/">Suck re-runs</a> show up in your LiveJournal friends page.&nbsp; It's like it's coming from an old pal....<br />[3]&nbsp; Up with footnotes.</p>
