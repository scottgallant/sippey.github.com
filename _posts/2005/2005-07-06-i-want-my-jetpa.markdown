<p>If we're supposedly living in this glorious future of <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">personalized news</a> and <a href="http://myweb.yahoo.com/">social search</a> delivered through <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com">flashing desktop widgets</a> and <a href="http://www.ambientdevices.com/">ambient devices</a>, why don't I have lights flashing and bells whistling alerting me to the fact that it's 12:01 a.m, and there's no apparent BART settlement?&nbsp; This is one piece of news that absolutely will have a tangible impact on my day (and demeanor) tomorrow...why don't I know about it now?</p>

<p>Whine, moan.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp; OK, so no BART strike.&nbsp; That's a good thing.&nbsp; I still want my jetpack, though.</p>
