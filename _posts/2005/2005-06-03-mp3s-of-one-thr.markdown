<p>The BBC will make their broadcasts of all nine Beethoven symphonies <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/beethoven/downloads.shtml">available for download</a> as MP3s.&nbsp; They'll only be available for a limited time, starting the day after each symphony is broadcast.</p>

<p>(In my dream world of hyper integration, the beeb would have an iCal file or equivalent one-click method available to put events / tasks into my calendar, or, better yet, to create scheduled tasks / crons on my machine at home.)</p>
