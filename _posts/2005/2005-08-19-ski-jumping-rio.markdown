<p>The Bay Area's all a-twitter with news that the steepest couple of blocks on the Fillmore Street hill in Pacific Heights will be <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/08/19/BAGV4EA9741.DTL">turned into a ski jump</a> later this month so that <a href="http://www.icersport.com">Icer</a> can hawk their line of gear, MTV can shoot a half hour special, and has-been Olympic star Johnny Moseley can celebrate his 30th birthday.&nbsp; Neighborhood residents are flipping out (pun fully intended); especially the couple that's scheduled to wed that Saturday in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The best bit in the Chronicle story, though, was this -- the ski jump thing's been done before, about 70 years ago in Berkeley, and it led to a very Berkeley outcome...</p><blockquote><p>In February 1934, the 
Auburn Ski Club of Truckee put 43,000 cubic feet of snow&nbsp; --&nbsp; four times the 
amount headed for Fillmore Street&nbsp; --&nbsp; on six Southern Pacific boxcars and 
shipped it to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=berkeley+ca&amp;ll=37.874913,-122.258928&amp;spn=0.006115,0.010131&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">steep slopes of Hearst Avenue</a>, just north of the UC Berkeley 
campus, for a ski jump demonstration. About 45,000 people, including thousands 
on Tightwad Hill, gathered to watch the novelty.<br /><br />But in true Berkeley fashion, the event ended in a riot. College students,
many of whom had never seen snow before, stormed the barricades and launched 
an enormous snowball fight, disrupting the event before it could finish. </p></blockquote><p>Here's to history repeating itself, with thousands of Pac Heights residents, led by the bride and groom, storming the slopes and pummeling Moseley and the Icer crew with snowballs.&nbsp; Now <em>that</em> I'd pay to see.</p>
