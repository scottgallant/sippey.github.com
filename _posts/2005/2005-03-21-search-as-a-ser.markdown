<p>This is probably obvious to most, but it just hit me in the face this morning:&nbsp; desktop search is best executed both as an app (&quot;I'm going here to find something&quot;) and as a component of the OS (&quot;I need to attach a file to this message, now where is that again?&quot;).&nbsp; Something as simple as baking search (and ideally fast preview) functionality into the File Open dialog would go a long way towards enabling <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000687.html">&quot;search rather than browse</a>&quot; behavior.</p>
