<p>Update from the one to one future, courtesy of the Detroit Free Press:&nbsp; <a title="GM's OnStar will e-mail monthly maintenance updates to car owners" href="http://www.freep.com/news/statewire/sw121209_20050913.htm">GM's OnStar will e-mail monthly maintenance updates to car owners</a>.</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>The new service, called OnStar Vehicle Diagnostics, will be featured exclusively in vehicles made by General Motors Corp. It will automatically perform hundreds of diagnostic checks on key operating systems: the engine and transmission, antilock brakes, air bags and OnStar itself. The vehicle is automatically programmed to send the results through e-mail, along with maintenance reminders based on the vehicle's odometer reading and remaining engine oil life.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Such a no-brainer, and a potentially very useful service for those among us who routinely let the oil engine light go on before remembering to actually change the oil.&nbsp; It'll be interesting to see how GM handles these messages, and what balance they strike between utility and marketing fluff. </p>

<p dir="ltr">(Of course, it would be great if they'd offer these via Atom or RSS so they can be syndicated on a blog, and have high-cost alerts (&quot;You need a new transmission!&quot;) automatically kick off a Drop Cash campaign to raise the appropriate funds.&nbsp; But hey, that's me.)</p>
