<p><a href="http://www.scottberkun.com">Scott Berkun</a> tosses off something interesting in a <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/?p=152">quick post</a> pointing to recent reviews of his (most excellent, highly recommended) book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007868/statingtheobviou/"><em>The Art of Project Management</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Most folks don’t know it but the window for books is small: if it’s not picked up in reviews soon after publication, odds are slim anyone will ever even hear about it.&nbsp; My own interests aside, any time you write a blog post or amazon review for a book, it makes a huge difference to us authors.</p></blockquote><p>This is &quot;Long Tail 101,&quot; of course[1], but it's always great to hear it straight from the authors out on the tail, so support the ones you love!</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp; What's the over/under on how long it will take until a top 20 MBA program offers a course in <em>The Economics of the Long Tail</em>?</p>
