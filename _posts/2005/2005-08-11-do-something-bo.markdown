<p>Now for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a>, an <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/reference/oblique.html">Oblique Strategies</a> widget, featuring the aphorisms from the micro-famous card deck by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt.&nbsp; OK, design geeks:&nbsp; the clock is ticking.&nbsp; Just how long will it take for someone to convert Bruce Mau's <a href="http://www.brucemaudesign.com/manifesto.html">Incomplete Manifesto for Growth</a> into an attractively beveled and opaque widget?&nbsp; On second thought, forget Bruce Mau, how about a tastefully animated bright red slideshow of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Zedong">Chairman Mao's quotations</a>?&nbsp; One of those oughta get the creative juices flowing when you hit a dry patch. <em>(Via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/43Folders">43Folders mailing list</a>.)</em></p>
