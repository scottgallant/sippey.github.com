<p>For the GTD in Outlook folks (and you know who you are), there are <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/files/pdc2005-outlook12.wmv">two</a> <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/files/pdc2005-outlook12b.wmv">videos</a> up on Paul Thurrott's <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/">SuperSite</a> for Windows <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/pdc2005.asp">from PDC 2005</a> that are worth watching.&nbsp; The first one shows off Outlook 12's new &quot;to do bar,&quot; which is viewable when you're reading email, and the ability to right-click and automatically create a task from a message.&nbsp; The second one shows off the integrated RSS reader, and the rebuilt search implementation.&nbsp; (It's.&nbsp; About. Time.)</p>

<p>Outlook 12 isn't getting the UI overhaul that the rest of the Office suite is (the changes in v11 were probably enough for most folks), but the simple &quot;right click, make task&quot; feature will be addition enough...</p>
