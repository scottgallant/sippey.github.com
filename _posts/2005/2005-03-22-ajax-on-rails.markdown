<p>Ruby on Rails <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/03/22/rails-0110-ajax-pagination-non-vhost-incoming-mail/">0.11</a> is out, and it includes <a href="http://rails.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionView/Helpers/JavascriptHelper.html">helper tags</a> for doing Ajax-style development.&nbsp; (Plus, bulit in pagination support, inbound email handling, and <em>very</em> importantly, &quot;Rails applications no longer require their own virtual host to be easy to set up.&quot;)&nbsp; They're starting to make building CRUD-heavy web apps ridiculously easy.</p>
