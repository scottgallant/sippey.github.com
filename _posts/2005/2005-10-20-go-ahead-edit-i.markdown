<p>I usually don't post little tips like this, but this one is just too simple, useful and undiscoverable to pass up.&nbsp; Courtesy of the 43 Folders discussion list:&nbsp; <a href="http://groups.googlegroups.com/group/43Folders/msg/7c3b89e7df1d5e46">subject line editing</a> in Outlook:</p><blockquote><p>First, double click the e-mail (or hit enter) to open it in a separate window. Then put your cursor on the subject line and start typing. That's it. You can add your own reference - date, project number, whatever - or change the subject line completely. Whatever is going to be meaningful to you. Use as many words you like. When you're done, Ctrl+S to save.</p></blockquote><p>Go nuts.<br /></p>
