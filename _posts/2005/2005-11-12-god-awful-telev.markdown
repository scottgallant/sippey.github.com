<p>Have to get this in under the wire, before the &quot;one week to talk about the latest episode&quot; elapses.&nbsp; That &quot;live debate&quot; on The West Wing?&nbsp; Possibly the worst 20 minutes of television I've ever seen.&nbsp; The other 40 minutes were viewed in Tivo triple fast forward, just to see if anyone in the &quot;audience&quot; would shoot one of the candidates to put themselves out of their own misery.</p>

<p>What's the equivalent of &quot;spinning in your grave&quot; if you're alive?&nbsp; Whatever it is, Aaron Sorkin's doing it.</p>
