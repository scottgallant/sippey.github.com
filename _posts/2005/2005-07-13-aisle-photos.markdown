<p>I really like Bryan Boyer's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryan/sets/584137/">Aisle of Averages</a>...</p><blockquote><p>Perspective shots of grocery store aisles are distorted back out of
perspective so that the shelf forms a rectangle in the picture plane
instead of trapezoid. Then four passes of motion blur @ 999 to arrive
at a kind of loose average or wash of the shelf's chromatic contents.</p></blockquote><p>...even though I'd rather imagine Bryan mounting his camera on a shopping cart, setting the exposure time to 10 seconds and then hurtling the cart down the aisle shouting &quot;Fore!&quot;<br /></p>
