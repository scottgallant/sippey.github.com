<p>Kudos to Rogers Cadenhead (a) for using his newly nabbed BenedictXVI.com to benefit <a href="http://www.modestneeds.org/">Modest Needs</a>, and (b) for the delightully arch &quot;Katie?&quot; at the end of his <em>Today</em> show appearance.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(I'm sure it will be linked all over, but here's the href anyway:&nbsp; <a title="Supporting Modest Needs" href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/entry/2005/04/21.html">Supporting Modest Needs</a>.)</p>
