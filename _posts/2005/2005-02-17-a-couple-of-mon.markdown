<p>A couple of months back I posted a shoot-from-the-hip <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/12/initial_thought.html">review</a> of MSN's Desktop Search beta.&nbsp; I'm here to recant.&nbsp; Eat my words.&nbsp; Take it all back.&nbsp; Because I now <em>love</em> the thing.</p>

<p>The main complaint I had with the product in December was its UI -- too many butterflies, too few customization options, a results screen that could use a bit of smart information design.&nbsp; And while in its default configuration the app's interface is a bit, well, <em>blue</em>, if you explore the app's functionality a bit (and take the time to tweak), it's well worth it...</p>

<ul><li>First, turn off the toolbars in IE and Outlook.&nbsp; You won't need them, unless you really want to be searching MSN.com as well as your desktop.&nbsp; I'm assuming you already have a popup blocker, or at least have installed SP2.</li>

<li>Second, make sure the deskbar / taskbar toolbar is turned on.&nbsp; If you're not a butterfly fan, apply the <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/bpaddock/archive/2004/12/14/17500.aspx">registry hack that kills it</a>, leaving you with a nice, plain white box.</li>

<li>Third, configure a keyboard shortcut.&nbsp; Mine's F9.&nbsp; Anywhere I am in Windows, I hit F9, and focus goes to the search box.</li>

<li>And finally, make sure that you've configured the app to list results as you type -- to get the quick results window that pops up from the taskbar and filters in real time.</li></ul>

<p>With those simple steps, you'll end up with lightning fast access to your email and local docs.&nbsp; After a couple of months of solid use, I've found that I rarely use
the full search results window.&nbsp; The popup &quot;list results as you type&quot;
window typically is all I need to find the message / document / contact
I'm looking for.&nbsp; (Yep, just like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/spotlight.html">Spotlight</a>. 
But available today.)&nbsp; Take the time to read the help file -- you'll learn you can use Lookout's search syntax, and do quick queries like &quot;from:mena website launch&quot; to find messages from Mena about a website launch.</p>

<p>To <em>really</em> take advantage of the product, learn how to set shortcuts using &quot;@&quot;.&nbsp; (Just type @ into the deskbar, and the app will provide a pointer to some bare-bones but useful documentation.)&nbsp; I'd be worried if I were a LaunchBar clone; Microsoft's managed to shoehorn 80% of the functionality of the popular keyboard-based app launchers out there into the desktop search product.&nbsp; Typing &quot;@gmail,http://gmail.google.com/&quot; into the deskbar assigns a shortcut; next time I want to visit Gmail, all I need to do is hit F9, type gmail, and my default browser opens up and navigates there.&nbsp; You can launch URLs, apps, folders or documents that way -- which means no more navigating through the hellish hierarchy of the Windows start menu or cluttering the desktop with shortcuts to frequently used docs or directories.</p>

<p>Anyway -- a long-overdue eating of crow.&nbsp; There are things I'd love to see -- a superfast preview window that highlighted keywords in context, for example -- but I trust they'll get there.&nbsp; And in case you're wondering what Redmond's success in this category means for companies further south, I've learned that such exercises are best left to the reader...or at least Battelle.</p>
