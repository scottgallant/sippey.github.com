<p>Finally got around to watching <em>Kill Bill</em> (both volumes).&nbsp; Why hadn't someone forced me to do that sooner?&nbsp; The mix of kung fu and spaghetti western was pitch perfect; as were the soundtrack, the wire work, the time shifting, the mix of b/w and color. etc., etc.&nbsp; Despite its length, Tarantino did a great job of not mucking up the revenge plot with too much backstory -- there was just enough to make the time-shifting worthwhile.&nbsp; I probably could have done without the bleeping of The Bride's real name, but the other cute &quot;I'm an auteur&quot; tricks weren't nearly as annoying as they were in Pulp Fiction.&nbsp; The anime sequence was brilliant, and the battle between Thurman and Liu in the snow was one of the more beautiful set pieces I've seen in a long time...</p>
