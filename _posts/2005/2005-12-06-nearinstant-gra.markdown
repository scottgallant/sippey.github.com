<p>Byrne's got a great post on Majordojo, <a href="http://www.majordojo.com/archives/2005/12/kill_your_cable.php" title="Kill Your Cable Television">Kill Your Cable Television</a>, where he outlines an interesting plan for Netflix -- near-instant delivery of recently aired episodes of popular television shows.&nbsp; Why wait a year for a season of Lost to come out on DVD?&nbsp; If the iTMS can ship it in a week, then Netflix should be able to aggregate a few recent episodes onto a DVD and ship it to subscribers.&nbsp; Netflix's lack of jewel boxes turns out to be a strategic advantage over retail (and not just a logistical/shipping advantage) in this scenario...</p>
