<p>Seen scrawled outside the Journalism School on the campus of UC Berkeley this afternoon:</p>

<p><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/berkeleyjournalism20050501.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=500,height=375,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Berkeleyjournalism20050501" title="Berkeleyjournalism20050501" src="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/images/berkeleyjournalism20050501.jpg" width="450" height="337" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>In case that's tough to read, here's the transcription...</p>

<blockquote>Journalism students.  I have a good story, maybe a great story, a local government mini-Watergate.  You want it?  The first one to contact me get exclusive.  (the story ties to Atty. General Bill Lockyer) boatbrain@aol.com.  Oh, I have Lockyer's home number, too.  Might come in handy.</blockquote>

<p>The home number thing is a nice touch, don't you think?</p>
