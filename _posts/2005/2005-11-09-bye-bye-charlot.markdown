<p>Because I know you've been waiting patiently to find out if I threw <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/11/i_am_getting_an.html">the book</a> across the room...I did. Wolfe's silly attempts to capture the &quot;fuck patois&quot; of the college campus (&quot;Look at me, I'm down with the lingo!&quot;) were exhausting, the ending was a cop out (everything too neat and tidy, the characters' fate decided by a third-rate, two-dimensional bit player), the last few pages a spastic attempt to project some sort of ill-fitting psychological profile on to Charlotte.</p>

<p>No more Wolfe for this reader.&nbsp; Any suggestions for palate-cleansing novels?</p>
