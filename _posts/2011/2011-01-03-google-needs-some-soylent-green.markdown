<p>I like this point that <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2011/01/threes-a-trend-the-decline-of-google-search-quality.html">Anil makes today</a>, rounding up some recent complaints about the quality of Google&#39;s search index...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is worth noting now is that, half a decade after so many people began unquestioningly modifying their sites to serve Google&#39;s needs better, there may start to be enough critical mass for the pendulum to swing back to earlier days, when Google modified its workings to suit the web&#39;s existing behaviors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a word: social. Now, I&#39;m no search expert (by any stretch of the imagination), but if you think about what&#39;s fundamentally different about the web today v. ten or even five years ago it&#39;s the explosion of content creation, sharing and discovery that&#39;s happening through networks of friends.  So adapting to today&#39;s web will mean tweaking search algorithms to take advantage of available social sharing (links + graph), and building more mechanisms to capture social data. I don&#39;t think this is just about using social data to personalize your search experience, but using social data as a fundamental way to improve results for everyone, and make the search experience better. Inject some people into that PageRank.</p>
