<p>Wil Shipley's post <a href="http://blog.wilshipley.com/2011/03/celebrating-betrand-serlet-and-craig.html">Celebrating Bertrand Serlet and Craig Federighi</a> is about as opposite in tone from this morning's Gizmodo post as you can get...and that's worth celebrating.  "So, we’re losing a great man in Bertrand, and we’re gaining one in Craig. I think most people want to know 'is this good for Apple?' Well, what’s good for Apple is: Bertrand wants to do something different, Craig wants to do this, and the most effective employees are the ones who are doing exactly what they want."</p>
<p>I'm not part of that community, and I've never come close to meeting either man, but reading Wil's post was a joy: it's full of respect, passion and love for the people behind the products.</p>
