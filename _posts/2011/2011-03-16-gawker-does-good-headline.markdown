<p>I ran into <a href="http://fimoculous.tumblr.com/" target="_self">Rex Sorgatz</a> in the Austin airport yesterday afternoon*, where we were contractually obligated to talk about the <a href="http://gawker.com/" target="_self">Gawker</a> redesign. (For the record, while it&#39;s generally inadvisable to bet against Denton, I&#39;d take Rex&#39;s side of <a href="http://fimoculous.tumblr.com/post/3164786607/gawker-bet-nick-denton" target="_self">the bet</a>.) My take: what was missing for me in the redesign was the ability to do the quick scan -- to get the &lt; 2 minute read on the Gawker take on today. The &quot;blog view&quot; makes it better, because my GOD they write the best damn headlines. &#0160;Here are a few from today:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gawker.com/#!5782610/bob-woodwards-not-just-some-lazy-facebook-troll-like-you-kids" target="_self">Bob Woodward’s Not Just Some Lazy Facebook Troll, Like You Kids</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gawker.com/#!5782598/meghan-mccain-i-only-blow-off-work-when-i-get-dumped" target="_self">Meghan McCain: I Only Blow Off Work When I Get Dumped</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gawker.com/#!5782501/courtney-love-wants-to-snort-kurt-cobains-ashes" target="_self">Courtney Love Wants to Snort Kurt Cobain’s Ashes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gawker.com/#!5782448/sex-with-33-girls-too-much-for-old-berlusconi" target="_self">Sex With 33 Girls ‘Too Much’ for Old Berlusconi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>* Look, kids -- name dropping and conference dropping in one clause! Having a discussion about Gawker while in the Austin airport should have earned us both some sort of &quot;My God, could you be more cliche?&quot; badge on Foursquare.</p>
