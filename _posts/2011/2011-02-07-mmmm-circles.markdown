<p>All those <a href="http://d2o7bfz2il9cb7.cloudfront.net/main-qimg-a4b26cf9e638fc11e1033b6ac6ec60bc" target="_self">overlapping circles</a> were just calling out for <a href="http://mlkshk.com/p/G8N" target="_self">one more circle</a>. (To be clear, it&#39;s not that doing it alone isn&#39;t fun, it&#39;s just not as fun as the real thing. And yes, I recognize that the act of adding even one more circle to the circle, um, fest could be considered more than a little bit onanistic.)</p>
