<p>Via <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2011/01/06/one_year_in_one_image">Matt Webb</a>, Eirik Solheim&#39;s <a href="http://eirikso.com/2011/01/04/one-year-in-one-image/">One year in one image</a>, which is a year-long timelapse view out his window in Oslo, Norway, sliced into a single image. It&#39;d be cheating for me to post the image here; go check it out on his site for the full context and to learn what&#39;s next with the images he has.</p>
