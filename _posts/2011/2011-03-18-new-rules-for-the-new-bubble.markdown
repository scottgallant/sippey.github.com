<p><a href="http://steveblank.com/2011/03/18/new-rules-for-the-new-bubble/">Steve Blank has a great post on the new bubble</a>.  &quot;Startup exits in the next three years will include IPO’s as well as acquisitions. And unlike the last bubble, this bubble’s first wave of IPO’s will be companies showing “real” revenue, profits and customers in massive numbers. (Think Facebook, Zynga, Twitter, LinkedIn, Groupon, etc.)&#0160; But like all bubbles, these initial IPO’s will attract companies with less stellar financials, the quality IPO pipeline will diminish rapidly, and the bubble will pop.&quot;</p>
