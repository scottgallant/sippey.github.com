<p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/03/21/october131994.html">Dave Winer&#39;s first &quot;blog post&quot; was October 13, 1994</a>.&#0160;He uses that fact as a springboard to remark on how the evolution of blogging to what it is today hasn&#39;t exactly been an unguided and autonomous process. &quot;Designing software is hard work. The things that seem obvious after-the-fact were anything but obvious before. The best things, the most useful innovations, are the ones that seem so obvious later that they melt into the fabric of reality and become invisible.&quot; Yes. (See also all the recent discussion about baked v. fried blogging platforms.)</p>
<p>(And since we&#39;re throwing dates around, my first &quot;blog post&quot; was <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1995/08/01.html">August 1, 1995</a>. It linked to Dave, of course.)</p>
