<p>Dave Pell has a great post about how social media (oh God I want a new name for this stuff so badly) turns us into <a href="http://tweetagewasteland.com/2011/01/now-sellng-on-the-web-you/">salespeople for ourselves</a>. &quot;The social web changes the entire selling equation. Thereâ€™s no more emotional friction associated with a sales job. The age of subtlety is dead. So we all push the product nonstop and <strong>the product is us</strong>.&quot; Emphasis mine.</p>
