<p>Jonah Peretti once <a href="http://gothamist.com/2005/06/04/jonah_peretti_director_of_rd_at_eyebeam.php">told Gothamist</a> that &#8220;the Internet is powered by bored office workers who sit at their desks forwarding emails, surfing the web, reading and writing blogs, and IMing funny links to their friends.&#8221; He called this the <strong>Bored at Work Network</strong>, or BWN.</p>

<p>The mobile corollary to the Bored at Work Network is the <strong>Bored in Line Network</strong>, or BLN. Mobile is powered by bored smartphone owners standing in line, updating their Facebook statuses, reading Twitter, thumbing through Instagram, playing a turn on Words with Friends, checking in on Foursquare or flinging an Angry Bird.</p>

<p>Web experiences have optimized for the BWN: related story links, skyscraper ad units and share buttons designed to divert attention and spread virally to other bored people. Mobile experiences are quickly optimizing for the BLN: bite-sized moments of media consumption, content sharing or game play designed to last as long as it takes for the person ahead of you to pay for their groceries. </p>

<p>So?</p>

<ul>
<li>Being on the home screen matters. When you&#8217;re bored in line, do you reach for an app or for your phone&#8217;s web browser? </li>
<li>If you&#8217;re translating your web experience to mobile, think about if and how it works for the BLN. Would <em>you</em> read your site while bored in line? (Relatedly, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive web design</a> is necessary but not sufficient tool for the mobile web.)</li>
<li>Remember that with the BLN, you&#8217;re not competing against your competition. You&#8217;re competing against Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and the dopamine rush of flinging an angry bird at those obnoxious green pigs.</li>
</ul>
