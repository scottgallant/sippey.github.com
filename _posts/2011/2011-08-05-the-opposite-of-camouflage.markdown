<p>Go read Matt Webb's post on the Berg blog that recounts a recent talk he gave on the <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2011/08/03/the-robot-readable-world/">Robot-Readable World</a>. As Matt points out, QR codes feel crude and obvious, and over time we'll find ways to embed information that is not only designed for devices, but is built to <em>entice them to use it</em>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Timo and Jack call this “Antiflage” – a made-up word for something we’re just starting to play with.</p>

  <p>It is the opposite of camouflage – the markings and shapes that attract and beguile robot eyes that see differently to us – just as Dawkins describes the strategies that flowers and plants have built up over evolutionary time to attract and beguile bees, hummingbirds – and exist in a layer of reality complimentary to that which we humans sense and are beguiled by.</p>

  <p>And I guess that’s the recurring theme here – that these layers might not be hidden from us just by dint of their encoding, but by the fact that we don’t have the senses to detect them without technological-enhancement.</p>
