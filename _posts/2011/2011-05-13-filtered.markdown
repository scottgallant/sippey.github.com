<p>I star/heart things compulsively. In a moderately particular order...</p>
<p>Ben Fry, co-creator of Processing&#39;s <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/05/13/ben-fry-on-visualization-future-and-data-literacy/" target="_self">remarks on data visualization tools</a> getting into the hands of amateurs: &#0160;&quot;The more that people are doing the work — it all kind of goes to improve the conversation of what’s good, bad useful and what’s not.&quot; Amen. / Speaking of visualization, these <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/05/13/plush-statistical-distribution-pillows/" target="_self">plush statistical distribution pillows</a> look fantastic; much better than the pillow pets that have invaded my house... / More visualization: via Kottke, <a href="http://kottke.org/11/05/silly-charts" target="_self">silly charts</a>.</p>
<p>Tim Bray&#39;s <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/05/12/IO" target="_self">wrapup post on Google IO </a>is a good read, especially for what he did during his welcoming address, asking everyone to take three minutes and introduce themselves to the people around them. &quot;The experience was striking as the noise in the room ramped from audience hush to barroom roar in about a half-second.&quot; Be sure to click through to see his photo of what happened. I need to remember to do this next time I&#39;m in front of a big crowd;&#0160;it&#39;s the conference version of passing the peace in church.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://trenchant.org/" target="_self">Adam Mathes</a> is doing textagon-styled <a href="http://trenchant.org/daily/2011/5/12/" target="_self">lessons on product management</a>: &quot;product management is the precise application of the word NO.&quot; I wish I had learned that earlier on in my career; saying no is hard, and when done well should be rewarded more than saying yes. / Speaking of the ability to say &quot;no,&quot; the <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/post/5420078798/wilwheaton-oh-shit-via-reddit" target="_self">sky/net mashup joke</a> that made its way around the web just wasn&#39;t as funnyscary as it would have been back when Microsoft mattered more.</p>
<p>Micro-micro-media: there&#39;s an email newsletter called&#0160;<a href="http://www.quid.pro/2011/05/i-like-a-lounge-as-much-as-the-next-guy-but-still.html" target="_self">Lounges Monthly</a>, for people who enjoy airport lounges. / On the consumption end of the spectrum, Ken Norton on things that <a href="http://www.heynorton.org/post/5429722988/file-under-stuff-that-would-have-blown-my-16-year-old" target="_self">would have blown his 16-year old mind</a>. (File under everything&#39;s amazing nobody&#39;s happy.) / Khoi Vinh <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/05/12/forecast-for-music-in-the-cloud" target="_self">reimagines digital music packaging</a>. &quot;So much happens around the music that we enjoy, but why go elsewhere to conduct the kind of social interchange — tweets, blog posts, updates, amateur covers, video riffing — that an album inspires when you could just use the album itself as a gateway?&quot; (I&#39;m not so sure...I&#39;m rather a fan of those tweets, blogs, updates, covers, video riffing...)</p>
<p>Finally, two of my favorite Internet micro-stars, talking: <a href="http://necessaryfiction.com/writerinres/InterviewwithJoshuaFirelandAllen" target="_self">Kevin Fanning interviews Joshua Allen</a>. &quot;I feel like the time I’ve put in writing stuff for the internet has been one long throat-clearing, but I have no idea what I’m going to finally say.&quot;</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
