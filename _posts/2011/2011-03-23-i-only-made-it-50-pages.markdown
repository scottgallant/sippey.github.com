<p><a href="http://orbooks.tumblr.com/post/4029114270/listen-im-never-going-to-read-finnegans-wake-i">Graydon at OR Books</a> posts about the challenge of reading <cite>Finnegans Wake</cite> while lauding Stephen Crowe&#39;s <a href="http://wakeinprogress.blogspot.com/">page-by-page illustrations</a> of that impenetrable fortress.  &quot;Have you ever attempted to just finish reading <em>the first page</em>? I have a better chance of getting called up by the Mets than finishing that thing, and I bat ninth and play right field for my rec league softball team.&quot;</p>
