<p>Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross will score the soundtrack to the American version of <cite>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</cite>.  I liked this bit from <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/41150-trent-reznor-and-atticus-ross-to-score-david-finchers-ithe-girl-with-the-dragon-tattooi/">Pitchfork&#39;s note</a>...</p>

<blockquote><p>The book, which has already been made into a successful Swedish movie, delves into some very dark territory, which means Reznor should be right at home.</p></blockquote>
