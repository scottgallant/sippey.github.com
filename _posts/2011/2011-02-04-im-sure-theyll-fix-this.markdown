<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/02/the_daily_wait">John Gruber on how long it takes to load a new issue of The Daily</a>:  &quot;Imagine a paper newspaper that was wrapped in an envelope, and the envelope was so difficult to open that it took over a minute before you could see the front page of the issue. Who would buy that newspaper? No one, thatâ€™s who.&quot;  I agree, but this is one of those things that I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll fix, hopefully quickly. But when they do make the launch experience better they&#39;ll still have <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2011/02/the-daily.html">more fundamental issues</a> to address...</p>
