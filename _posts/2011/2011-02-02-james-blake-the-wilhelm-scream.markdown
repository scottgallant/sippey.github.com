<p>Go listen to / watch <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVgEaDemxjc#" target="_self" title="Yep, it&#39;s good too.">The Wilhelm Scream</a></em>, another track from James Blake&#39;s upcoming album.&#0160;(If you recall, Blake&#39;s cover of Feist&#39;s <em>Limit to Your Love</em> made my list of <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/12/my-top-9-songs-of-the-year.html" target="_self">top 9 tracks of 2010</a>.) Found via Pieter at Today and Tomorrow, who <a href="http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/2011/02/02/the-wilhelm-scream/" target="_self" title="It&#39;s a great blog, you should read it.">accurately notes</a>&#0160;that&#0160;&quot;it’s been a while since I’ve seen such a hyped album, but it’s probably worth it.&quot;</p>
