<p>File under the &quot;even if it&#39;s fake it&#39;s real&quot; category, Jill Dawsey <a href="http://blog.sfmoma.org/2011/01/jill-dawsey-vik-muniz/">uses Vik Muniz&#39;s <cite>Spiral Jetty after Robert Smithson</cite></a> as a jumping off point for a great post about the real <cite>Spiral Jetty</cite>.  &quot;I donâ€™t mean to suggest finally that visiting <cite>Spiral Jetty</cite> in person provides an experience more authentic or real than the other ways (Nonsites, photographs, stories) one encounters the work.  For if Muniz gets <cite>Spiral Jetty</cite> and its environs slightly wrong, that is also how he gets it right.  <cite>Spiral Jetty after Robert Smithson</cite> is a copy that announces itself as a copy, a photograph twice removed from the famous work it references.&quot;</p>
