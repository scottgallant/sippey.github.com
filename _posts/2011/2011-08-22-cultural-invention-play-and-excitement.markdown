<p>Great <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/arts/design/design-firm-seeks-to-humanize-technology.html">profile of Berg</a> in the New York Times. I loved this bit from Jack Schulze...</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Historically, design has associated itself with utility and problem-solving, but we prefer the landscape of cultural invention, play and excitement,&quot; Mr. Schulze said. &quot;When technology is infinitely complex, and our attention increasingly finite, producing something you can act on and observe at a human and cultural level is hard.&quot;        </p></blockquote>
