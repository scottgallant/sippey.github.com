<p>In the future, Urban Outfitters will learn from its mistakes. Instead of <a href="http://imakeshinythings.tumblr.com/post/5855716317/not-cool-urban-outfitters-not-cool">stealing designs</a>, they&#8217;ll &#8220;steal designs,&#8221; and leverage its sullied reputation to increase sales. Here&#8217;s a simple three step guide to how they&#8217;ll do it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Identify an indie designer whose products they&#8217;d like to &#8220;steal.&#8221; Strike a secret deal with said designer, whereby they license the designs and agree to share revenue back with the designer.</p></li>
<li><p>List new products for sale on UrbanOutfitters.com. Designer &#8220;complains&#8221; on the Internet, fueling outrage on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc., driving traffic both to the designer&#8217;s indie store as well as UrbanOutfitters.com. Milk the self-righteous anger over Corporate America Stealing Designs for incremental sales and awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Profit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This would make for a great test, comparing sales driven directly through UrbanOutfitters.com (using all their standard marketing tactics - SEO, SEM, merchandising on the site, etc.) to sales on the indie designer&#8217;s store front, with awareness driven primarily through viral / social means. Of course, it&#8217;s a tactic best used sparingly, lest those pesky Internet people catch on to what you&#8217;re up to.</p>
