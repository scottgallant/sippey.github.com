<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/#!5784786">Gizmodo speculates</a> on why Bertrand Serlet, the father of Mac OS X, is leaving apple.  "Now, as the company moves into its modal-based, touch-centric future, Serlet may have disagreed with this merging of iOS and Mac OS X philosophies in Lion, which will eventually lead to a complete migration to a new unified OS, more iOS than OS X."</p>
<p>Other unconfirmed things Serlet <em>may</em> have disagreed with, that <em>may</em> have led to his departure:</p>
<ul>
<li>The brand of coffee in the Apple cafeteria.</li>
<li>The kerning of the type on his business cards.</li>
<li>The naming strategy for Apple conference rooms.</li>
<li>The colors of the new iPad cases.</li>
</ul>
