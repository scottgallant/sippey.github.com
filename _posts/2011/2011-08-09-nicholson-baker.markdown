<p>Nicholson Baker's new novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/143918951X/ref=nosim/statingtheobviouA">House of Holes, a Book of Smut</a></em> is out today. The Times Magazine had a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/magazine/nicholson-bakers-dirty-mind.html?pagewanted=all">nice profile</a> of Baker this weekend, but I also like <a href="http://www.themillions.com/2011/08/ham-steaks-and-manstarch-nicholson-baker-returns-to-the-sex-beat.html">The Millions' review</a>, which (more succinctly) connects the dots between Nicholson's non-smut work like <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080214490X/ref=nosim/statingtheobviouA">The Mezzanine</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679734406/ref=nosim/statingtheobviouA">Room Temperature</a></em> to <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679742115/ref=nosim/statingtheobviouA">Vox</a></em>, <em><a href="0679759336">The Fermata</a></em> and now <em>House of Holes</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nicholson Baker has been thinking about rigid stonkers and prime Angus cockbriskets spewing hot loads of silly string into various slutslots and lettuce patches. That, plus cold iced tea, and the little bubbles that you see when you shake up a bottle of salad dressing. Baker’s many fans are sure to lap it up. The rest of us will be slightly amused but ultimately bored.</p>

<p>I'm a fan, and I'll lap it up. But I have to wonder just how many people will be reading it undetected on their Kindles on the subway or the bus, enjoying their own little Fermata-like moment, undetected. I'm sure Baker's curious, too; remember his <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/03/090803fa_fact_baker?currentPage=all">ambivalent piece on the Kindle</a> in The New Yorker from two years ago?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had some success one morning when I Kindled my way deep into “The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Writing Erotic Romance,” by Alison Kent. There are, I learned, four distinct levels of intensity in the erotic-romance industry: sweet, steamy, sizzling, and scorching. </p>

<p>My God, the guy can even make the word "Kindle" sound dirty.</p>
