<p>This morning friend of the show Mike Monteiro <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Mike_FTW/status/66189757662756864" target="_self">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever. I’ve got an editorial calendar and it says right here that on Thursday I’m supposed to take on Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I&#39;ve followed Mike on Twitter for quite some time, and I don&#39;t doubt his willingness or ability to take on all of Europe on a Thursday. However, I was pretty sure he was kidding about having an editorial calendar. So I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sippey/status/66191860984594432" target="_self">asked Twitter</a>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HEY TWITTER: Let&#39;s build an editorial calendar for @Mike_FTW:&#0160;<a href="http://typewith.me/e9ZTaraeZu" target="_self">http://typewith.me/e9ZTaraeZu</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And oh did people respond. I love the Internet.</p>
<p>TypeWithMe -- the service I linked to -- is an <a href="http://etherpad.com/" target="_self">EtherPad</a> descendent and lets (up to 16) people collaborate on a document at one time, color coding contributions along the way. &#0160;I had it open in a tab for a lot of the day, and watched the multi-colored insanity just pour in. If you visit that URL above, it&#39;s probably still going. (I wonder what the half life of the contents of that document will be over the &quot;long&quot; run?)</p>
<p>For, um, posterity the current state of the document is&#0160;<a href="http://www.sippey.com/files/mike-ftw-edit-calendar.html" target="_self">archived here</a>. There are lots of Gruber jokes. And Phillies jokes. I ran it through OS X&#39;s text summary service to get it down to something excerptable, and here&#39;s what came out:</p>
<ul>
<li>May 16, Mon: Pitch @zeldman AEA talk topic, &quot;Fuck all y&#39;all, pay me, by which I mean, make your checks out to Mule Design right now.&quot; Afternoon tangent: Post Instagram from Twin Peaks opining how much better it is to walk up a hill with a beard</li>
<li>June 7, Tues: Make a new t-shirt making fun of Gruber &amp; sell it at WWDC in the exhibit hall.</li>
<li>June 8, Wed: Trick Dan Benjamin into letting me onto The Talk Show in order to gang up on John with Dan making fun of the Yankees.</li>
<li>August 5, Fri: Spend an episode of Let&#39;s make mistakes on how a random tweet three months ago landed you a ridiculously packed calendar.</li>
<li>August 6, Sat: Wish a happy 30th birthday to the first thing to wreck @Maria_Pete&#39;s vagina, then chuck the calendar and choose to do your own thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yep. That works. If you haven&#39;t contributed your own, <a href="http://typewith.me/e9ZTaraeZu" target="_self">you still can</a>.</p>
