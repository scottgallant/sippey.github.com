<p>Via <a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/3475/why-would-anyone-hate-the-library-amy-poehler-explains/" target="_self">Jessamyn West</a> comes this great <a href="http://www.latimesmagazine.com/2011/01/q-la-amy-poehler.html" target="_self">Amy Poehler interview</a> where she talks about how people who work in local governments really do hate the library. &#0160;&quot;People who work in the library think they are so much better than everyone else. And what’s really funny is we’ve been doing Q&amp;A’s about our show, and people from local governments have said, &#39;You guys nailed it about the library.&#39; We were just making it up as a joke on the show, but I guess everyone hates the library.&quot;</p>
