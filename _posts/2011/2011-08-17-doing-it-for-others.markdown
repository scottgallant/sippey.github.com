<p>Via <a href="http://putthison.com/post/9040478446/the-real-value-of-classic-mens-style">Put this On</a> comes this waaaay-inside baseball men's <a href="http://www.parkandbond.com/the-intersection/p-o-v/in-defense-of-the-reblog-responses-to-the-significant-other">fashion blogging discussion</a> at Park &amp; Bond about whether men are dressing for themselves or dressing for women or dressing for other fashion bloggers. (Yeah, I don't care either.)</p>

<p>BUT. Buried in the piece was this nice little bit from <a href="http://afistfulofstyle.tumblr.com/">A Fistful of Style's</a> Alex Yakovleff.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many -- if not most -- people posting on the Internet <em>are</em> trying to show off to the Internet (myself included).  You’re posting pictures to the Internet. Are you really going to argue "I’m just doing it for <em>me</em>, man!"? Because that’s kind of unbelievable.  Of <em>course</em> you’re doing for others, at least to some degree.</p>
