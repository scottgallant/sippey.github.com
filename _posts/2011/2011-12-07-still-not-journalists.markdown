<p>I can't believe we're still having this argument...and losing. Headline on Time.com: <a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/12/07/oregon-court-rules-blogging-isnt-journalism/">Oregon Court Rules Blogging Isn't Journalism</a> (tastefully illustrated with a Getty Images stock photo of the words "blog blog" coming out of an antique typewriter).</p>

<p>See also this afternoon's stream of tweets from <a href="http://www.gothamist.com">Gothamist's</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a>. Presented in chronological order...</p>

  <p>Today's update: I filed the official appeal on my (2nd!) denied application. And Norm is also going to talk w/the city's attorneys. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin/status/144461089588002817">#</a></p>
  
  <p>At this rate, I'm almost certain to have a press pass before @gothamist's 15th anniversay in 2018! <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin/status/144461407985991680">#</a></p>
  
  <p>I don't understand how @MikeBloomberg can claim NYC is friendly to startups, when @gothamist still can't get a press pass after 7 years. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin/status/144565103134654464">#</a></p>
  
  <p>We're a NYC born and bred media startup that employs more than twenty-five people. We work hard to deliver original content every day. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin/status/144565282575355904">#</a></p>
  
  <p>Last month we had 2.5MM unique readers in New York City. But the @nypdnews tells me we're not a real news organization. That's just wrong. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin/status/144565585932595201">#</a></p>
  
  <p>But how can we be expected to deliver more original content if we're denied the same access mainstream news organizations take for granted? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin/status/144565943228563456">#</a></p>
  
  <p>I just can't believe that it's going to take a lawsuit to get us the same basic treatment newspapers, radio, and TV stations get every day. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin/status/144566170601791488">#</a></p>
  
  <p>So next time someone accuses a blog of aggregating- ask yourself, how can they avoid aggr without all the tools to produce original posts? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jakedobkin/status/144566503113637888">#</a></p>

<p>We've democratized the tools of content production, distribution and monetization to the point where Jake can build a sustainable media business that employs 25 people and reaches millions of readers. But as Jake rightly points out, the set of "tools" he needs to run his business go beyond a CMS, a CDN and some SEO. It also includes tools that give his contributors <em>access</em>.</p>
