<p>I'm leading a panel discussion at an event in a few weeks, and I was asked if I would need anything above and beyond the usual (projector, mics, etc.).  And since I'm regularly asked to lead panel discussions, I thought I'd share my rider in the spirit of making <em>your</em> panels better...and easier to organize in the future!</p>

<p>Here's the list of what I ask for every time I appear at an industry conference.</p>

<ul>
<li>An old school overhead projector with seven clear transparencies and four colored markers (green, red, black and blue)</li>
<li>A supersized post-it note flipboard, with six colored markers, preferably the ones that have nice smells (strawberry, lime, blueberry, licorice and cherry)</li>
<li>A bullhorn, with a spare set of batteries</li>
<li>Three stick-on clown noses</li>
<li>One pair of groucho marx glasses with attached nose and moustache</li>
<li>Juggling pins</li>
<li>Three quarts of flourescent paint. Seven 2" and five 1" paintbrushes.</li>
<li>Black lights to fill the room</li>
<li>Eight cases of bottled water</li>
<li>One hunting knife, preferably serrated</li>
<li>2 x 50ft lengths of braided polypropylene general purpose rope</li>
<li>11 flourescent green glow sticks, at least 6" in length</li>
<li>Six rolls of 1.87" wide silver duct tape</li>
<li>24 10x10 clear plastic sheets / drop cloths</li>
<li>2 body bags</li>
<li>Three sheets of CIA-grade blotter acid</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and SxSW is going to be awesome this year. You should definitely vote for the panel Ted Rheingold and I are organizing: <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/9824?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F10%2Fname%3Adog">On the Internet, Everyone Knows You're a Dog</a>.</p>
