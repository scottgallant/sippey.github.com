<p>Sony Pictures has posted a PDF of <a href="http://flash.sonypictures.com/video/movies/thesocialnetwork/awards/thesocialnetwork_screenplay.pdf">Aaron Sorkin&#39;s screenplay for <cite>The Social Network</cite></a>. It reads as well as you&#39;d think it would; but if you&#39;ve seen the movie it&#39;s impossible not to see the film&#39;s action in your mind&#39;s eye as you make your way through it. Like a blueprint of an existing building, it&#39;s a plan for a thing that&#39;s already made its way into the world. Once you&#39;ve seen the building, it can&#39;t be read purely as the plan.</p>
