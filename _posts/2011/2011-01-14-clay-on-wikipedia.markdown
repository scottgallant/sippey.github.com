<p>Clay Shirky pens <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jan/14/wikipedia-unplanned-miracle-10-years" target="_self" title="Go read it.">a paean to Wikipedia</a> on the occasion of its 10th birthday. I like this bit: &quot;Wikipedia is best understood not as a product with an organisation behind it, but as an activity that happens to leave an encyclopedia in its wake.&quot; I wonder how well you could apply this thinking to other forms of media.&#0160;Thought experiment: &quot;The New York Times / Gawker / 30 Rock / the TED Conference is best understood not as a product, but as an activity that happens to leave ______________ in its wake.&quot; And then use that frame of reference to generate a list of related activities.</p>
