<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2046052,00.html">James Poniewozik&#39;s ode to Friday Night Lights</a>. I didn&#39;t connect with his Woody Guthrie comparison, but I like this closer:  &quot;Just as HBO&#39;s crime-drama masterpiece <em>The Wire</em> was a searing vision of what is wrong with America, <em>Friday Night Lights</em> has been a clear-eyed, full-hearted tribute to what is right with it.&quot; I haven&#39;t been watching Season 5 (don&#39;t have DirecTV, and haven&#39;t been pirating it), so am very much looking forward to feeling emotionally devastated on a weekly basis when it runs on NBC.</p>
