<p>I missed this when it was published last month, but I love Pitchfork&#39;s list of their <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7967-words-and-music-our-60-favorite-music-books/">60 favorite music books</a>. Blogging this as a reminder for when I somehow find myself without a new book in the queue.</p>
<p>Particularly loved this bit about the retitled Greil Marcus book, which went from <em>Invisible Republic</em> to <em>The Old, Weird America</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a single evocative phrase, Marcus inadvertently articulated a collective nostalgia (part real, part imagined) for the strange, creaky old folk songs that animated the first half of the 20th century in America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wouldn&#39;t be a Pitchfork list without some bitching about what they missed, so...how the hell did they not include Marcus&#39; <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lipstick-Traces-History-Twentieth-Century/dp/0674535812">Lipstick Traces</a></em>, too? He deserved to be on there twice.</p>
