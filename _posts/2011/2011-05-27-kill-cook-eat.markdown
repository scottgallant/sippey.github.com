<p>Mark Zuckerberg, <a href="http://postcards.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2011/05/26/mark-zuckerbergs-new-challenge-eating-only-what-he-kills/">foodie</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This year, my personal challenge is around being thankful for the food I have to eat. I think many people forget that a living being has to die for you to eat meat, so my goal revolves around not letting myself forget that and being thankful for what I have. This year I&#8217;ve basically become a vegetarian since the only meat I&#8217;m eating is from animals I&#8217;ve killed myself. So far, this has been a good experience. I&#8217;m eating a lot healthier foods and I&#8217;ve learned a lot about sustainable farming and raising of animals.</p>

<p>The clock is ticking on how long it will take an ambitious food entrepreneur to open the first &#8220;kill it, cook it, eat it&#8221; retail space in a major metropolitan area. It would be the natural evolution of urban food retail (i.e. wine bars, boutique grocers, cooking schools) and the local food movement: a clean, well-lit place where sophisticated urbanites can experience the guilt-wracked thrill of slaughtering their own chicken...and then poaching it in white wine.</p>

<p>To maximize site utilization, they&#8217;d offer a series of classes on sustainable urban farming, slaughtering techniques and best practices in home butchering. The space (with staff and animals) would be available after hours for private kill/cook/eat events, perfect for team building or birthday parties. And with the right set of equipment, kill/cook/eat could come to you, extending the &#8220;home-delivered meals&#8221; concept a bit further.</p>

<p>There&#8217;d be the obvious logistical challenges, of course &#8211; animal transportation, waste management, zoning, etc. But with the right branding, kill/cook/eat can command a significant price premium over other other urban food experiences. After all, it&#8217;s not about the meal, it&#8217;s about being more thankful for the food you have to eat.</p>
