<p>Fantastic documentation of what looks like an amazing project from Dash Marshall in New York: <a href="http://www.dashmarshall.com/projects/kga/" target="_self">An Apartment for Space Age Lovers</a>. It features a Black Hole. &#0160;&quot;The Black Hole is a flexible zone which can be annexed to the living room or bedroom, or optionally kept closed as a large walk-through closet space depending on the needs of The Lovers. It&#39;s big enough to gobble up anything The Lovers need to hide.&quot; I&#39;d like to hire them just to <em>describe</em> my house.</p>
