<p><a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2011/03/feature_product.php">Kevin Kelly on features, products and companies</a>. &quot;[The feature] may be novel, useful, desirable, and marketable. But how big and autonomous will it be? Is it big enough to sell as a product in itself, with all the necessary support that requires?  And is that product big enough to be able to sustain a company and all the overhead an organization demands?&quot;</p>
<p>His conclusion, which you should go read for yourself, made me think that the inverse of Coase&#39;s transaction economics (and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm">theory of the firm</a>) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">attention economics</a>. Probably not an original thought, but it&#39;s the distinction between demand-driven company boundaries and supply-driven company boundaries.</p>
