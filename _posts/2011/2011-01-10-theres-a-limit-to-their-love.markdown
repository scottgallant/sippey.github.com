<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.thesinglesjukebox.com/?p=2982">The Singles Jukebox dissect</a> one of my <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/12/my-top-9-songs-of-the-year.html">top 9 from 2010</a>, James Blake&#39;s cover of <a href="http://vimeo.com/15624524">Limit to Your Love</a>.  Some love it...</p>

<blockquote><p>There are cover versions that are curios, accoutrements, or goof-offs, another jaunty tune or standard in your arsenal. But James Blake has bigger ideas here: “Limit to Your Love” is an underground music Hallelujah or Hurt, a cover that treats its forebear as a blueprint yet to be fully realised. Feist’s original is jaunty, warm, comforting. Blake’s is a spare beast wracked with tension, even pain — some kind of devotional cleansing, a confessional of sorts wrought in music.</p></blockquote>

<p>And some hate it...</p>

<blockquote><p>Forget dubstep; this is a high school glee club audition. You know, the kind where you walk into the choir room and sing a pop song, except James decided he’d go with a Feist album track to be hip.  He wheedles and closed-eye emotes his way through, reaaaaally slowly, as the bewildered accompanist plods alongside him, throwing in some harder chords to amuse himself. ... Eventually James finishes and leaves, prompting the entire audition committee to let gush their pent-up laughter. Except that part isn’t in the song. It should be.</p></blockquote>
