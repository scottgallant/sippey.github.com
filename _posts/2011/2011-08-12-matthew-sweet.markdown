<p>Matthew Sweet is not only <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/LolinaArtPottery">selling ceramics on Etsy</a>, he has a <a href="http://www.matthewsweet.com/">new record coming out</a> called Modern Art, <em>and</em> he's going on tour this fall. From Matthew Perpetua's <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/matthew-sweet-on-his-ambitious-new-record-and-taking-girlfriend-on-the-road-20110812">story at Rolling Stone</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It may be a while before fans will get to see Sweet and his band perform his ambitious new material. "I think it would be difficult to play live, just to have everybody learn it," says Sweet. "It's especially challenging because we're gonna tour to <strong>celebrate the 20th anniversary of Girlfriend</strong> this fall and we're going to be playing the whole Girlfriend album."</p>

<p>Emphasis mine. Twenty years!??!! I saw him play once and my GOD was it loud. In a good way. (You can stream a track off the new record at the RS post linked above. It's catchy!)</p>
