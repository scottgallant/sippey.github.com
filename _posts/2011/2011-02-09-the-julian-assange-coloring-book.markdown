<p>The best part about the <a href="http://www.julianassangecoloringbook.com/" target="_self" title="Yes. For reals.">Julian Assange Coloring Book</a> (aside from the fact that the Julian Assange Coloring Book even <em>exists</em>, of course), is the <a href="http://www.julianassangecoloringbook.com/gallery.php" target="_self" title="Seriously. This exists. I love the world.">gallery</a>, where Assange colorists can share their work. I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://www.julianassangecoloringbook.com/gallery/assangin_sane.jpg" target="_self">Assangin Sane</a>.</p>
