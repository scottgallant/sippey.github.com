<p>Two massive profiles of Alinea&#39;s Grant Achatz, one in the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/dining/chi-grant-achatz-chicago-chef-alinea-20110215,0,1811741,full.story" target="_self">Chicago Tribune</a> that (finally) passes the torch to Achatz from Charlie Trotter, and one in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/dining/16next.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_self">New York Times</a>&#0160;that compares Achatz to Michelangelo and his business partner Nick Kokonas to Medici.&#0160;Sure, both pieces are full of hyperbole. But go eat at Alinea and tell me it isn&#39;t earned.</p>
