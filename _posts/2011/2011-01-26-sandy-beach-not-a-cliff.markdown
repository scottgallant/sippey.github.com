<p>Matt Webb, who is my 2011 blog muse, has a great post up about <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2011/01/26/ufo_on_tape">UFO on Tape, Dance Central and the whole thing around augmented(ish) reality</a> that&#39;s happening with some iPhone appgames and XBox Kinect.  Worth reading in full. &quot;It&#39;s not super high tech or dramatic or woo-woo-flashy like the Minority Report interface. I don&#39;t know what to call it. But it&#39;s nice and humble and human, and I like it.&quot;</p>
