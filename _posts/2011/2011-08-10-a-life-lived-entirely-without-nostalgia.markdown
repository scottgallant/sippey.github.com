<p>I have a thing for nostalgia -- trying to understand the interplay between aging, romanticizing the past and the inevitable March of Progress. No grand theories yet, just a bunch of <a href="http://www.sippey.com/nostalgia/">blog posts that share a category</a>. But I've been reading with interest a bunch of posts lately from <a href="http://www.thingsmagazine.net/">Things Magazine</a> which are grappling with the same thing. <a href="http://www.thingsmagazine.net/?p=4812">Today</a>, commenting on <a href="http://booktwo.org/notebook/hauntological-futures/">a post</a> from James Bridle at BookTwo.org, they have this great bit. (Emphasis mine.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The author continues: ‘I am so bored of nostalgia. Of letterpress and braces and elaborate facial hair. I appreciate these things, but I think there’s something wrong with a culture that fetishises them to the extent that we currently do.’ Very probably. But such fetishists represent a very small part of wider culture, and their obsessions are – it would seem – almost entirely without impact or consequence. <strong>Is there a term for a life lived entirely without nostalgia, without any capacity for romantic and emotive engagement with the past?</strong> Futurist doesn’t seem to cut it.</p>

<p>Couldn't agree more that the hipster obsession with things like letterpress and facial hair has very, very little impact on the wider culture. But a term for a life lived entirely without nostalgia? Would have to be something very, very close to <em>amnesia.</em></p>
