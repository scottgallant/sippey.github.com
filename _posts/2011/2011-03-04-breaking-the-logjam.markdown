<p>It&#39;s been a busy couple of weeks; all appearances on this blog to the contrary. At SAY Media (where I head up our Artist Development efforts) we launched a new project: &#0160;<a href="http://say100.saymedia.com/" target="_self">The SAY 100</a>. There&#39;s an (overlong) post about it (and a video!) on the site&#39;s about page if you want to learn more. But here&#39;s the short story: &#0160;(a) we believe in strong voices, (b) we believe curation is a good thing, and (c) the best way to demonstrate those beliefs is to show who and what we&#39;re talking about. Huge kudos to the whole team at SAY that put the site together, and I had a blast working with the curators (Clay! Seth! Amanda! Jeff! Jane! and more!) who picked some incredible people. We threw a big party in New York this week to celebrate; thanks to everyone who came out.</p>
<p>Also, during the midst of the madness last week I made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8SzmQdlIog" target="_self">quick xtranormal video</a> of an imaginary debate between Jason Kottke and David Galbraith about the merits of The Hangover. <a href="http://kottke.org/11/02/debating-the-hangover" target="_self">Jason blogged the whole backstory</a>.</p>
<p>OK, enough about me. You&#39;ve seen the <a href="http://placekitten.com/" target="_self">placekitten</a> thing, right? Love it.</p>
