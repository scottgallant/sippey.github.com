<p>So Jason's gone and <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign">redesigned</a> Kottke.org, integrating all his content into one column, with all sorts of tricks to have movie reviews, book reviews, &quot;classic&quot; posts, remaindered links, etc., appear in-line but with mini-templates of their own. All of which is great, of course...I mean who doesn't love the big K? </p>

<p>Then why do I have this nagging feeling that someday we will all return to the talismanic ur-format of <a title="that goddamned microstar again." href="http://freedonia.com/~carl/">freedonia.com/~carl</a>, where everything's on one page, all scrollable, searchable (CTRL+F, anyone?) and even permalinked for user-friendliness. Categories? Context-providing Google links? Comments? Revenue producing reading lists? Micro-ads? Daily, weekly and monthly archives? Feh. It's all about the output.</p>

<p>Remember, kids: this is <a href="http://carlsteadman.com/">all his fault</a>. <em>All</em> of it. I blame Carl, and <a title="especially if you're into friendster -- five years ago carl messes with six degrees by inviting everyone as his life partner." href="http://www.rageboy.com/carlshead.html">you should too</a>.</p>
