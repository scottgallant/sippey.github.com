<p>There's a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=191540">new version</a> of POPFile out, which promises to dramatically improve performance (it's never been that slow for me), through a migration the corpus from a flat text file to a BerkeleyDB database.  But this caught my eye...</p>

<blockquote>In a future version POPFile will add official support for message classification through the SMTP and NNTP (Usenet news) protocols.</blockquote>

<p>POPFile + nntp//rss, anyone?</p>
