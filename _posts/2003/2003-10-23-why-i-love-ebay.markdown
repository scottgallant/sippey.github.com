<p>Reason #654 to love eBay:  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3146042998">Collection of 26 Beanie Babies from Ex-Wife</a>.</p>

<blockquote>I know nothing about these stuffed Beanie Babies. I offer no proof of anything. It is a stuffed animal, get over it! I don't think my ex-wife was in the Black Market Beanie Trade...but then again, I didn't know she was having an affair either!</blockquote>

<p>Welcome to friction-free commerce.</p>
