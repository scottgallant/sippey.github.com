<p>Why I just opted out of Amazon's "share the love" program:  I'm tired of receiving "look at how smart I am for purchasing this book, I thought I'd share this fact with the rest of the world!" messages gussied up as 10% off promotional offers.  Like "George" actually cares enough to send me a 10% discount on <cite>The History of Iraq</cite>*.  Puh-lease.</p>

<p>* Names and book titles changed to protect the guilty.</p>
