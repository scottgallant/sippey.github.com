<p>Three related things from this morning's news bin.  First, David Weinberger's <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002089.html">writeup</a> of Lessig's talk at POPTECH.  I heard Lessig last week (or the week before last?) at SFMOMA, giving what seems to be a similar talk, tuned for the art crowd.  The refrain was "free culture," where free was used both as an adjective and a verb.  Second, Denise Howell's <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/archives/2003_10_12_bgbg_archive.html#106640657876220489">writeup</a> of Doctorow and Dyson's panel at Digital ID World.  Agree with the danger of unintended consequences of captured data (enforcing privacy policies is a <i>human</i> problem, not a technology problem), but find the potential RFID use case of smart furniture just a <i>tad</i> far-fetched.  Third, Werbach on <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2003/10/17.html#a1267">what is Internet infrastructure</a>, which reminds me that end-to-enders need more case studies like Akamai to prove commercial viability of building smart apps on top of the dumb infrastructure instead of the other way around.</p>
