The six of us were seated right in the kitchen, <a href="http://www.charlietrotters.com/restaurant/tour/index.asp?imgID=6">within arm's length</a> of the chef de cuisine; watching him orchestrate chefs, hosts, wait staff and expediters was something to behold.

<p>I'm usually suspicious of celebrity chef <a href="http://www.charlietrotters.com/store/">enterprises</a> (Trotter's latest book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1580084702/statingtheobvioua/"><i>Raw</i></a>, was published on Tuesday by Berkeley's <a href="http://www.tenspeedpress.com/">Ten Speed Press</a>), but the experience we had on Saturday night is making <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1580083153/statingtheobvioua/"><i>Lessons in Service from Charlie Trotter</i></a> a tempting purchase...</p>
