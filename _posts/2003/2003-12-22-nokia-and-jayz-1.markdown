<p>Nokia's <a href="http://adweek.com/aw/regional/southwest/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2056335">introduced</a> a limited edition version of the 3300 music phone, with a preloaded version of Jay-Z's <i>Black Album</i>.  Never mind that the phone would be <i>much</i> better if it came preloaded Prince's <i>Black Album</i> -- this is something like a marketing strategy for the iPod I <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/new/2003.07.28.html">wrote about</a> in July...</p>

<blockquote>An iPod that's shipped with, say, 250 pre-loaded tracks offers rich opportunities for market segmentation, channel diversification (sell the country iPod in the guns and ammo section of Wal-Mart?), device customization (through store.apple.com) and price point differentiation.</blockquote>
