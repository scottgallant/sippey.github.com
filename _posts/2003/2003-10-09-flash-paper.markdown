<p>Jeremy Allaire <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/10/08.html#a246">posts</a> about <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/10/08.html#a246">Flash Paper</a>, a Macromedia alternative to Adobe's PDF.  While I agree with the notion that we need alternatives to the ever-bloating PDF monster, Macromedia's missing a key user modality with digital documents -- email attachments.  PDFs get saved, forwarded, marked up, forwarded on again, reused, repurposed, in a way that web-bound Flash paper documents couldn't...  Even if Macromedia gave away the Flash paper producer (unlike Adobe, which charges a hefty sum for it), they'd need to be in bed with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/">intranet</a> / <a href="http://www.lotus.com/">workspace</a> providers to make sharing those docs as easy as emailing an attachment...and then they'd <i>still</i> have a problem with offline use and heavy inbox addicts...</p>
