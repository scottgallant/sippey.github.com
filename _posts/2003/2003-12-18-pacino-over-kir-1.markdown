<p>As if we needed confirmation that the Hollywood Foreign Press is completely out to lunch:  Pacino got the miniseries actor nomination for <i>Angels in America</i> instead of Justin Kirk.  Pacino's Roy Cohn was <i>very</i> Pacino -- bugeyed, raw, vocal and engaging, to be sure.  But Kirk's Prior Walter was masterful; you couldn't ask for more subtle, nuanced and emotionally rich acting.  His soliloquy address to the continental principalities ("<i>addicted</i> to life") and the final scene in Central Park will stay with me for <i>months.</i></p>
