<p>Haughey launched <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/">PVRBlog</a> less than three months ago.  It's already such a popular resource for information about digital video recorders that the PR folks from <a href="http://moviebeam.com/flashindex.jsp">MovieBeam</a> offered up an exec for an <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2003/10/interview_with_.html">email interview</a>.
