<p>Useful Tip #2 of the day (where Michael realizes his new role in the blogowhatever).  If you're using a Treo 600 on Sprint, go download Handspring's <a href="http://support.handspring.com/esupport/forms/hsResolutionView.jsp?Reso lutionId=9444&lstProducts=4442">beta email app</a>.  It's free, and overcomes a significant limitation in the otherwise more fully-featured Snappermail; Handspring's app allows you to attach photos directly from the Treo's in-memory picture database, instead of requiring you to first move the photos to an SD card, a step that pretty much killed the spontaneity of emailing off a pic.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, maybe some cooking and house cleaning tips.  I'm on a roll, here.</p>
