<p>Part of the genius of Sofia Coppola's <i>Lost in Translation</i> was her ability to insert two subtle Bill Murray pop-culture (self)references and have them actually <i>enhance</i> the emotional tone of the movie rather than crush it under the knowing wink of irony.  Exhibit A:  the man who essentially <a href="http://snl.jt.org/char.php?i=394" title="snl archives : nick the lounge singer">wrote the book</a> on over-the-top lounge singers doing a delicate karaoke rendition of Roxy Music's <i>More Than This</i>.  Exhibit B:  the audience connecting the dots between the younger Murray on the golf course <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0080487/" "it's in the hole">in 1980</a> with the elder Murray stepping up to a Mt. Fuji-framed tee and hitting a picture-perfect drive with a picture-perfect swing.</p>
