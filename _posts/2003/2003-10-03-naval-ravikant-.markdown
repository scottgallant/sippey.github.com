<p>Naval Ravikant <a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000194.html">injects some sense</a> into the current blog-o-meme about the supposed "death of email."</p>

<blockquote>Sure, a few, tech-savvy people will get frustrated and try and use a different mechanism. Many will use webs of trusted whitelists (think sixdegrees on your address book) or challenge-response systems. A few will storm off to some new, secure communications mechanism, that authenticates senders and imposes a true cost on them. Even fewer will migrate to wholly new paradigms like "shared workspaces."</blockquote>

<p>(Just to be clear, I most certainly have <a href="http://www.quris.com/">a stake</a> in the future of the inbox.)</p>
