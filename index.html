<h1>this is sippey.github.com</h1>

<p>
I'm wrangling sippey's website and mucking about with git and github.  There's nothing to see here, move right along.  If you're really looking for things, then you should check out <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/">sippey.typepad.com</a>.  It's a blog.  With the word "sippey" in the title.

Thank you.
